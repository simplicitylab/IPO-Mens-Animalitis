    "description": "The last time I owned cats was when I was 14. We had them from before I was born until we put one down at 9 and the other at 14; I'm now 22 and moving out on my own soonish (within the next year or so hopefully) for school. I really, really want a cat to help keep me sane during school and because cat.\n\nHowever, since the last time I had one was when I was a kid, I have no real context for how expensive cats are outside of cans of food. Everything online is from several years ago and I know prices have changed since then.\n\nHow much does your cat run you on an average year? Or cats if you have more than one? What about on a particularly bad year where they ate a bra strap or something (like Boris the Cosmonaut Kitten from Facebook did last year)? Would it be financially reasonable to adopt a cat on a student budget? Help!\n\nEDIT: i'll be going to graduate school, not college. It's a 2 year academic program with a 1 year paid internship, basically.",

    "description": "My 4-5 month old kitten is very aggressive. I got him as a present after my cat passed away last year, but I was not involved in the selection process. \n\nThe person my uncle got the kitten from obviously thought he was much older than he was, or didn't care enough about kitten development to keep him longer, because he was at least 5 weeks old when I got him but less than 7 weeks. I'm pretty certain his parents were feral or semi-feral and he was born outside.  \n\nThis has presented several challenges. 1. He peed on my bed for 3 weeks. 2. He has no sense of aggression limits. I do not play with him with my hands or feet but he continues to attack them pretty viciously. Even when my hands are still, in my lap, he finds them, bites them and then starts licking me. I don't know what to do. \n\nI love the little booger, and he is otherwise sweet and calm but I don't want him to be aggressive towards other people. He even bites my 1.5 year old cat really, really hard (no blood but lots of pained meowing) and tears his fur out. I have never had a problem like this with a cat of mine. Has anyone else had this problem before? \n\n\nP.S. I know it's not good to give pets as presents. Please do not berate me or the gifter. I was actively searching for a kitten and would have preferred to be involved but I wasn't and that is just the hand I was dealt. I wasn't going to just send the little baby back and I'm not going to attack someone who only had my best interests at heart. ",

    "description": "This isn't a joke. We have a 8-9 week old kitten. It should in theory be off the bottle by now. Let me clarify this; We have tried EVERYTHING!!! here is what we tried:\n\n-Wet food (beef, turkey, chicken, tuna)\n\n-Dry food (normal or crushed)\n\n-Put the milk by itself in the bowl\n\n-Mix the milk with wet food\n\n-Try adding water to wet food to make it thinner\n\nRight now we are stuck with literally feeding him watered down wet food from the bottom with an open nipple. He understands the concept of the bowl with water in it, but food itself I don't get it, he just refuses to eat anything off the bottle. And then out of nowhere he will start licking dust off the floor!\n\nNow here is where its serious. He is visibly getting weaker, he's having trouble climbing on things that he was able to climb no problem a week or so ago. He is almost at the point of skin and bones. He gets cold very easily because of that. I personally don't think I am a bad pet owner as we have another cat and lizard who both are well fed and perfectly healthy. I sincerely need help, its making me so sad looking at this kitten. Someone please help, Thank you.\n",

I have had pets throughout my life, and love animals. However, I have only had dogs, rabbits, hamsters, never a cat...! I am excited but also nervous. I read one of the older posts asking for some advice, and got some mixed answers. \n\nSome outstanding concerns and questions I have are how to nurture and raise the kitten so it grows into a loving, cuddly and energetic cat? I want a cuddly pet - not one that will run away from me... Also, when I first bring the kitten home, it will be 8 weeks old (I am adopting it from a Foster Humane Society program). Where should I put the litter, and the carrier? I understand the kitten will be lost and scared upon its visit introduction, and I want to make sure he is comfortable in its new home. \n\nNext, I work. Full time. My job is sometimes pretty demanding, and so my days can be long. This makes me nervous...! I am trying to introduce the cat to its new home at a good time so I can at least be home Saturday, Sunday and let it get accustom to me while getting used to its new place. But, what should I do Monday before I leave for work? Will the kitten be ok all day on its own? \n\nAnything else I should consider? \n\nThank you all in advance - you are all awesome! I look forward to sharing photos and making quirky posts with you all :)",

    "description": "My cat, female, ~4 years old. Adopted her almost 2 years ago. Always been the most peaceful creature in the world, the Jackson Galaxy's \"Mojito Cat\". She **never** showed any signs of agression towards anything (except birds). Because I adopted her and spend most time with her, she's way more bonded with me than other people in the house (she seems to feel \"below their rank\", while I'm more of a \"bro\").\n\nAbout a month ago during daily playtime something snapped in her, she started clawing (not playfully, full aggression) my leg instead of her toy. I jumped away, she kept looking straight into my eyes, while walking around me and meowing like she's begging for something. I wanted to go to another room, but when I turned my back towards her she jumped on me and tried to claw my head. I pushed her away from me, she again started walking around me and meowing. After several attempts to calm her down (resulting in more attacks) I shouted at her, which made her run away and hide in the closet. I was scared, angry and confused so I went to my room. An hour later she came back, purring and rubbing against me, then sat on my lap like nothing ever happened.\n\nSo far she had 5 such episodes, each longer and more vicious. Normally, I would assume it was some overstimulation aggression, but:\n\n* she doesn't look angry or scared (ears up and to the front, calm tail etc.), just meowing and looking straight at me.\n\n* it also happens when we aren't playing, seemingly without any apparent reason (I know there's always a reason for animal aggression).\n\n* when this happens she's agressive only towards me, and seems to completely ignore other people even if they're trying to draw her attention from me (my friend picked her up to take her away and she didn't react).\n\n**tl;dr - my cat after 2 years of love suddenly attacks me, and 5 minutes later she wants me to pet her.**\n\nDoes anyone know what might cause this, or had similar thing happen to their cat? Might it be that she got so comfortable around me she now wants to gain dominance? Of course, I'm taking her to the vet, but I can't do it until sunday so I decided to also ask here.\n\nP.S. I don't know if this might help but I had long hair before adopting her and cut it short a week before this started happening. Maybe she keeps forgetting for a moment who I am because of my new hair, however that doesn't sound right considering it's been over a month now.",

I didn't see this but suspect it was play or just cats being cats). The lady decided to put the little guy down as a response to this, and will not be convinced to take him to a shelter or otherwise try to get him adopted.\n\nI've offered to take him in so that i can see if he gets along with my cat first, see if i can get him adopted second, and take him to a no-kill shelter third. This little guy is absolutely adorable and really deserves this chance.\n\nHe's been fixed, he's up on his shots, and has not been declawed. As stated above, he may not play well with other kitties but does great with people and hasnt had any issues using his litterbox or anything like that. I'm picking him up this weekend.

    "description": "I got my kitten when he was 9 weeks old and he is now 22 weeks old. He has had all vaccinations and has been nurtured. He is extreamly naughty! Just today he tried to jump on the wardrobe, fell and smashed the light bulb in my bed side table and just jumped at the light in the living room causing the shade to fall off. He has plenty of toys and climbing furniture and he is always jumping up on counter tops. I have tried spraying him with water, covering the sides of the counter tops with tin foil. I just don't know what I can do, he is so lovely when he is sleepy just when he is running crazy he is destructive. If it's normal kitten behaviour I will deal with it I love him so much. I just want him to be happy, and telling him off makes me so sad. Any suggestions will be extremely helpful :) ",

    "description": "We've had Mittens for 3 years now (she was my roommates before I moved in here, and she adopted me as her fulltime owner). Last week my girlfriend and I adopted a new kitty, a white domestic short hair with beautiful eyes, and named her Abra. She's a very placid cat, while mittens is very territorial, she'd hiss and growl whenever Abra came near, but never attacked her. Her outbursts have decreased, but there's still some animosity in the air. Abra doesn't react in anyway to Mittens' threats, she was a stray before we adopted her, so we think she's use to intimidating cats. \n\nNormally Mittens is a food vacuum, she'd eat anything and everything (even one of my boogers and piece of onion once). Her favorite time of day is when she's fed. She'd yell until the food bowl was placed on the ground. These last few days, however, she's been very apathetic about food. She doesn't eat that much, and when she does it's not with the same vigor she once did. Could she be feeling depressed over Abra? How can we remedy this? It breaks my heat seeing her do downtrodden. She hasn't really been acting differently, but the food is a big deal for her. \n\nTl:Dr: adopted a new cat. Current cat who loves food has become very apathetic towards it and doesn't eat as much as she did.",

Upon returning to the comfort of the house I can see everything is exactly how I left it, which is nice. I've always been kind of a \"neat\" freak. Not necessarily neat, but everything has it's spot, and it's neat to me. Now when I say everything was how I left it, I mean everything. Even Toby was still in the same spot since he had woken up.\n\nAfter moving into our new home, he quickly seemed to favor one specific area in the house. Once everything was unpacked he never seemed to leave his sanctuary, except to eat, use the restroom, etc. I had been out in the yard, took care of the mouse problem the previous owners had left us, bathed, ate and had time for more while he was lost in his own mind. I never understood how he could sit there for so long, just staring at one spot, being entertained by quick flashes of light, and quiet noises, almost sounding like bells. Now don't get me wrong, I sneak a glance at whatever he's looking at and it looks interesting for a minute, but I can't understand any of it. \n\nI love that he has hobbies (if you can call it that) and things he enjoys, but it's getting late, I'm tired, and my litter box needs to be cleaned.\n\n\n",

She didn't ever turn around before going, so would sometimes spray out of the door, but it wasn't a big deal, like whatever she's old, y'know?\n\nIn November, I moved to a new place, and there are now two other cats here, both of whom use her litterbox (her litterbox is in my room, but as soon as I leave my room with the door even cracked, they go in and use it.)  I keep it cleaned religiously (I'm at home all day, so I literally mean it's scooped out within 10 minutes.)\n\nThis didn't seem to bother Pandora for the first week, but then she took to peeing on the floor outside the bathroom. (The bathroom is attached to the bedroom, for your mental picture.)  Then pooping there.  Then in the past week, she's started simply getting up, walking to the foot of my bed, and peeing on it.  (Conveniently, this aligned with my washing machine breaking, FML.)\n\nThe past few days she'd peed exclusively in her box, and shat on the floor.  Not ideal, but easier to clean up.  If I get up when she's in the middle of doing things in my room, she jumps and hides under the beds, but if I get up when she's using her box, she continues, so she seems to know that what's going on isn't appropriate.\n\n(Again, I don't know anything about cats, I'm just giving as much information about her behavior as I think might be relevant, sorry this is long-winded, we're almost done.)\n\nSo today, just now, prompting me to write this post she went to her box, pooped a little, hopped up onto my bed, peed there, and then while I was cleaning that up, pooped on the floor, and then while I was trying to clean the mattress, pooped in her box.  So she went from box, to bed, to floor, to box, in a couple minutes.  What... what even is that.  Help me, reddit.",

Around this time about 4 years ago a young female was dropped off in our neighborhood, she was sweet and super friendly and very vocal and also not fixed. At the same time there were 2 male strays roaming around both not fixed either. So winter passes and spring comes and we notice shes still around but much rounder I am sure you can guess what happened. My mom,dad and I talk it over we decide we'll take her in but in the mean time she had the kittens, she lead my niece to them not long after she was fine with us knowing they where there and looking in on them until we were set up inside for them but our neighbor noticed and checked them out the next day she moved them, she showed us again where they where, it wasnt far. And so we took her and them in they still could barely move and didnt have their eyes open. It took a day or 2 for her to settle in and realize we wanted to help and stop trying to move the babies outside. In the end we couldnt give any of them up. Our older cat loved them as she was use to having her brother around(bother also rescues)and he died not long before from a rare cancer.

We don't have a car where we live, so we found the best vet we could within walking distance and we're planning on walking him there inside a cat carrier. Since he's been pretty much indoors his whole life (except for when we first brought him home), I'm concerned that the journey itself will be overwhelming for him (loud honking, construction drills, and all the scary sounds of the city). On top of that, the vet visit itself will probably be very scary... \n\nI would greatly appreciate some tips on how to make this process a little less stressful for our furbaby. :)  ",

The only people who've managed to pet him without getting hissed at/swatted/bitten is my aunt and myself (to a lesser extent, after many frequent visits over several months)\n\nLast night I went over to change their water bowl and feed them their dinner and I immediately noticed Molson wasn't rubbing up against me like he always did. He wasn't avoiding me, but he seemed more wary than usual. As soon as I entered the room where Tucker was and approached his food bowl with the kibble he hissed at me from under the dining room table. I was very perturbed because I thought we had established a relationship better than this, so I put the food down at walked away for a few minutes hoping he would calm down or move away.\n\nApparently he didn't because the next time I went within 5 feet of him he screeched like a banshee and chased me, clawing at the air with claws extended. I quickly threw the food in the bowls and ran out of the house.\n\nI understand that this behavioural change might be because of a medical issue or an injury, or just a reaction to my aunt's emotional state/absence. All I can find online is long term solutions to cat aggression, but what I need is a way to protect myself in case Tucker gets hyper aggressive again until she can take care of him full time again. I've thought about wearing big thick work boots and several pairs of pants to protect my lower body but I'm not sure what the bite force of a cat is. I'm also well aware that my behaviour and attitude play a major role but I can't guarantee that I won't show signs of fear around this cat again. I'm also worried for Molsons sake, though he seemed to be uninjured when I gave him a few pats.",

    "description": "Our indoor cat has randomly started acting aggressively during the last few months. First time he acted this way was last March or April when I was carrying him in my yard and he acted like he wanted to go to our neighbors yard and started biting when I was walking away from the fence. When I got back inside and let him go, he immediately attacked my leg and when I took him off, he soon attacked again. This is not any \"playful\" attack, he bites really hard. Well, I escaped and closed my room and soon he started meowing and wanted to get in and slept next to me like nothing had happened. Now recently this has started to happen more often, usually right after I have walked to the mailbox and back while carrying him. I also have a leash and walk with him few times in a week. \n\nFew days ago, for the first time ever, he attacked my arm when I was reading in my bed. I let him keep biting out of curiosity for a while, and the result was several BLEEDING wounds from his teeth. \n\nHe used to have an older cat as a friend for his whole life until he died around a year ago, and I have wondered is my cat depressed because he has no other cat friend. He is clearly trying to suggest something I can't figure out. Is he just desperate for attention? Does he just desperately want to play? Does he miss his old friend? Is he dead bored? \n\nWe have planned to get another cat but my dad is against it.",

    "description": "I have a 3 month old kitten who has started to pee on my bed while my fiancee and I sleep. The first time she did it was our fault because I closed our bedroom door like I always did before we got her and she couldn't get out in the middle of the night. So I cleaned the comforter, but put it back in the same plastic bag as it was in before it was cleaned, and then brought it home. Not wanting to go back out to the cleaners for another round, I gave it a smell and it smelled clean, so we put it on the bed and two days later she peed on it again. I'm trying to figure out what needs to be done in order to keep her from doing this because I don't want to have to clean my comforter after every night. She's a great cat. Very friendly and happy. Loves to be around us when we are home. We both work during the day, so she is alone for a solid amount of time, but we both make sure we give her lots of play time when we get home and try to wear her out as much as we can before we go to sleep. I recently switched her litter to a arm and hammer order absorbent litter, so could it be that she doesn't like the way it smells? Could it be that there is still a pee scent on the comforter that we cant smell, but she does and thats why shes peeing on it? I have no idea, but if anyone could make some suggestions for me to try and hopefully put a stop to this it would be greatly appreciated.  \n\nHere is a [picture](http://i.imgur.com/CukPPy8.jpg?1) of her a few weeks ago when we got her. She's a very sweet cat and we love her tons. Just don't want this peeing thing to keep happening. \n\n\nedit: My fiancee just called and told me she peed on the bed right in front of her. Time to take her to the vet maybe? I read that she could be sick and this is her way of telling us. ",

Due to the damage to the house, my girlfriend and I needed to take the cat with us to our new apartment while the parent's house is attended to. The cat wouldn't come out from under a bed and hissed at anyone who approached; so we had to lift up the bed it was hiding under in the basement to get the poor animal out of hiding and into a carrier. \n\nQuite understandably, the cat is still very scared. We've put her in the apartment bathroom with food water and a litter box. She's hiding under the bathtu currently, and lacks appetite. To compound matters, we just moved in here 2 days ago, the apartment is not unpacked(is a mess at the moment), it's in the middle of a loud city instead of a quiet suburb, and we're not supposed to have pets here, so she'll need to be moved again soon.\n\nShort of anxiety meds, what should I be doing to mitigate lasting trauma to this once affectionate cat?",

    "title": "My boyfriend lost his cat, and we think his neighbor took it thinking it was their own. Help!",
    "description": "Ok I would so appreciate any advice on this because I am so lost at what to do.  My boyfriend had an indoor/outdoor cat named Steve that went missing two weeks ago. Steve was really good about leaving for a few hours to explore the neighborhood and meet other cats and coming right back, so it was surprising that he went missing.  Anyway, four days after Steve went missing, my boyfriend went to the humane society (again) to see if Steve was there, but he wasn't.  However, as he was leaving, he saw a flyer for a similar cat that went missing in his same neighborhood back in early August.  He texted the number on the flyer on a whim to make sure they hadn't found \"their\" cat in the last few days.  As a matter of fact, they claimed they had.  They said they found their cat, who had been missing for months, two days after Steve went missing and in the same neighborhood (they live in the neighborhood too).  They even sent  2 pictures of their cat.  One photo was time stamped on the day they supposedly found Steve.  It is unclear when the other was taken.  Steve and this cat look incredibly similar and are both neutered males and people friendly.  \nAnyway, the boyfriend is heartbroken about losing his cat and he's worried that the people who found \"their\" cat have actually taken Steve by mistake.  I've decided that I'm going to contact them to see if they'll let me see the cat to make sure it isn't Steve.  It's an awkward proposal, I know, but I hate seeing my boyfriend sad about this, and I feel like I come from a less threatening place since I'm a girl so they might be more likely to meet with me. So my question is two part:\n1) How can I prove that the cat is Steve (assuming it is).  So far, I have a few ideas about what would make Steve unique from this cat. Steve is less than a year old, so probably much younger than this cat (idk the other cat's age). In addition, Steve was neutered about a month and a half ago. Steve also had a small puncture wound on his cheek that was nearly healed when he got lost. It may be completely gone by now though, it's hard to say.  I'm also going to get his vet records to see if there's anything unique there. Is there any way to \"prove\" any of these things if I'm not a vet? Lastly, I have pictures of both Steve and \"their\" cat which I have attached.  If you see any kind of difference or similarity in marking that could prove (or disprove) anything, please let me know.\n2) How should I go about trying to get this lady to see her cat? I need a plan.\n\nThank you so much for reading all the way through! Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!  \n\n[pictures of Steve and other cat](http://imgur.com/gallery/AFNdb/new)",

    "title": "Other Causes for Licking Off Hair?",
    "description": "My 7-year-old cat, Louis XIV, compulsively grooms. Initially it was something he did a few years ago during a flea attack (he was biting at the fleas), and once I had gotten his medication right he stopped for months. Now, about two years later, he's back at it almost all the time and has what I call chicken legs as a result (fur is almost entirely gone on his legs), as well as his tail being shaped weird now because he removed the fur. His rump is also perpetually balding from his licking it constantly.  \nI read that things like scented litter, stress, strange cats, etc. can cause this, but I use unscented litter and he and my kitten Bergamot and I have lived in the same place for a year.  \nSo can anyone give me any OTHER possible reason my cat seems to have developed some kind of lower-body fur OCD...thing? Could there be stressors I am not detecting BESIDES the litter/new cat/new home suggestions? Allergies? Frustration? Older age? Do some cats just DO this? I'm worried because unlike his previous episodes this  one has not stopped for months.  \n\nAlso he eats his food too fast and vomits it up again rather often. Is that normal? Can I control that at all and if so how?\n\nDetails if necessary: 7-year-old orange tuxedo DMH, originallu belonged to an old lady who raised him from kittenhood but she died when he was 3 or 4. I got him from the pet store when he was 4.",

He would go home in the middle of the day and always beat me home in the evenings. He also didn't go out much so they always had someone at home with them and I sense they are missing that. They have retained their appetite and play occasionally with each other but they snuggle HARDCORE (unusually needy) when its time to settle down.

    "description": "So, my kitty is just finishing treatments for a ruptured anal gland. Ever since it happened (about a week ago), she refuses to poop in her box. She'll just go on the carpet, and rarely in the same spot. I've tried putting a second box with slightly different litter in a spot where she's gone a couple of times, but she still won't use it to poop in. I've tried moving the poop into the box, but that's not working either. I also moved her Feliway \"happy cat\" wall plug into the bathroom where the main box is. She's peeing in both boxes just fine. I'm sure she has come to associate her original box with painful pooping.  How do i get her to have positive pooping associations with her box again?",

    "title": "Frequent sneezing/cold symptoms after vet visit and vaccines?",
    "description": "So I took my cat Flakes to the vet last Friday for a checkup and vaccines (rabies and panleukopenia). He was also given a blood workup and urinalysis (both of which came out great according to the vet). About an hour after receiving the vaccines, Flakes started vomiting. He vomited at least 5 times in a 30 minute period and had diarrhea twice so we took him to the all night emergency vet clinic.\n\nThe vet there wasn't sure what the cause was but suggested stress or a vaccine reaction (but did say that vaccine reactions are quite rare in cats). We were given the option to do more testing such as blood work or x-rays (in case Flakes had an obstruction) OR we could treat symptomatically. I had brought copies of Flakes' blood work from literally 2 hours before so the doctor said that we probably didn't need to do that.\n\nIn the end, Flakes was given fluids subcutaneously, spent some time on an oxygen mask (he seemed to be breathing heavily when we arrived) and got a Cerenia shot. We also received anti-nausea and anti-ulcer medication but Flakes only got 1 dose of those before he absolutely refused to take them anymore (hissing and biting when he's usually VERY sweet and calm).\n\nFast forward to the middle of this week and now Flakes is sneezing - a LOT! He also has a runny nose and watery eyes but all discharge is clear with a watery consistency. He's eating, drinking, peeing, pooping, breathing and sleeping normally.\n\nThe question I have is do you think Flakes needs to go to the vet again? He had a very stressful time on Friday and I wonder if perhaps that is what triggered his vomiting the first night and his sneezing now. I did read about feline herpes and how stress can trigger it ([source](http://www.leospetcare.com/when-to-take-a-sneezing-cat-to-the-vet/)). What do you all think? Has this ever happened to your cat?",

    "title": "Street cat?? Good or bad????",
    "description": "So today this afternoon my Mum forgot about my cat being outside at the backyard again. (we don't have cat door so all we can do is open the door to the backyard and close it. We can't really install a cat door because out doors are metal and glass made so it's a little impossible. We'd have to replace the entire door.)\n\nI was inside my room hanging around with the window slightly open and i heard this growling in the backyard. I first assumed that my cat was sleeping somewhere inside the house and this was just a normal cat fight outside then i realized that he probably was still outside and so i opened my window and peeked in and i saw my cat facing a street cat that i recognize. (It did visit us couple of times before i got a cat)\n\nI made a comparison doodle: http://puu.sh/lJfRQ/9ffed56842.png\n\nSo my cat was just staring at him. It looked so confused. Or probably wanted to talk. It was probably because he saw the same cat before when he was 5 months old. (I'm not sure how cats works. I need help with that.)\n\nSo, I went downstairs as quickly as possible because i didn't want my cat to get hurt. And when i opened the door to the backyard the street cat ran away like a bullet to the wall he climbed down from to escape. And my cat looked at me, Meowed, Took few steps toward the wall and just stood there staring at the cat climbing till it faded away with the wind gently blowing on my cat's long wintery fur. It was strangely dramatic.\n\nI stepped a little closer to my cat, He turned back to me and meowed a lot more. I got really confused but didn't want from him to go after the street cat (I didn't want him to learn to climb up the wall because our neighborhood at night there's dogs and cat murder around and the least i could do is let him hangout in the backyard.) so i kinda lifted him up and carried him between my arms and let him stare at the tip of the wall then meow at me some more.\n\nNow, I don't know what to do here. Should i befriend the street cat or not let my cat get out? Or is it alright for them to meet and be pals or whatever? Because i am so confused.",

    "description": "Our cat which is about five months old was mounted by our other cat again. Yes, again. I read somewhere on the internet that adult cats get sexually aggressive when they can't mate with a female cat and can take this out on whoever's closest, which in this case is our other cat. The first time this happened, our younger cat won't eat, play, and have to be forced to eat (put pieces of fish near his mouth). He eventually got over it and everything's fine until he was mounted again. It got worse as he now hides or mostly sleeps in his box. His smell's kinda strong now and the fur on his paws suggests that he hasn't been cleaning himself for a while. We've been trying to give him food but he won't eat. He usually just drinks water. We gave him milk the other night and he drank some. We can't afford to get him checked out as of the moment. \n\nIs there anyway that we can make him eat or at least get back his energy? He used to be very playful and catches everything that moves. Any advice and tips are greatly appreciated. Thanks, guys.\n\nUPDATE: There also seems to be some sort of drooling and our younger cat (the one who was mounted) doesn't like to be pet or touched and hides away. ",

They don't like to bite into the water so they first drink the water out of their food and then proceed to eat.  I feed them twice a day and I've now gotten them to easily clear a cup of water per day just from doing this.  For anyone trying to keep their cats hydrated, I highly recommend giving this a try.",

Through this, I seem to have attracted a stray, who I think is a really nice feral cat. He's an un-neutered male, who hasn't been declawed and has no ID. My mother has asked around the neighborhood and every one has seen him, but no one owns him or knows where he came from. All of this leads me to believe he is currently homeless. I've been feeding him and want to adopt him, get him neutered, and make him a house cat, but I've heard feral cats are \"impossible\" to take into the house.\n\nReasons he might be feral:\n\n* Unfixed and has claws\n* Very fearful of me/my family at first, used to run away and not come to me even when I was offering him food and treats\n* Took him a really long time to realize that me = person who gives food, not a threat/potential source of harm\n* He is terrified of cat toys. I bought some thinking it could help us bond, but he hates them, backs away from them, and has no interest in exploring them\n* He guards his \"territory.\" He seems to be guarding my yard, especially his favorite corner of it where he sleeps. Even when he's not eating in my yard or sleeping, he \"stands guard\" just outside \"his bed.\" He'll be closing his eyes, falling asleep, but still won't leave his guard position.\n* Would not slow blink back to me. Now he sort of does it sometimes, but it doesn't really seem to be natural to him? Also, doesn't really like eye contact. He had a face injury, which I tried to look at, and he seemed scared of the eye contact.\n* Did not meow or make any sounds, besides howling at cats he doesn't like. I've been feeding him since May or June, and he recently started meowing or purring really softly and infrequently to me.\n\nReasons he might be stray who was originally owned by someone:\n\n* Generally, he is extremely gentle\n* Currently, after getting used to me, he allows me to pet him, rubs his head on me, even enjoys belly rubs\n* He now comes to me when he sees me, listens to me, comes all the way up to my door to tell me he wants food or wants me to come out etc.\n* I can pick him up in the arms, but not for long before he squirms out, and he doesn't really like it, but I feel like a true feral would not allow me to even pick him up\n* Has never hissed at me, bitten me, or scratched me, despite how much time I spend with him. I actually thought he was declawed for the longest time because he had never even shown me his claws or tried to swat at me or anything, but eventually I saw them when he stretches.\n* He howls at the other cats sometimes, but there is only one in particular that he fights with. He has contact with ~4-5 other cats, and there is only one that he has ever fought physically with. The feeling is mutual though and they both attack each other. I consider this pretty limited inter-cat aggression since I would imagine that an un-neutered male would fight more with others. He's also never aggressive towards me when I pull him away from the other cat.\n\nHow can I know if he's adoptable/domestic enough to take into my house? I tried to pick him up and bring him into my house, but he ran out as soon as he was in the door. Does he seem adoptable, or should he stay outdoors? And should I try to trap him and bring him to the vet? ",

    "description": "Hello Reddit!\n\nI'm in need of some help. I live in a beautiful neighborhood where my cats are able to go outside, and explore. They have been doing so for nearly a year. My boyfriend and I live in the 3rd floor apartment, of a 3 story home. His grandmother used to live in the house downstairs, and has recently moved. New tenets are moving in next month, and we're concerned about the cats running in and out of their home, and being disruptive; especially my one cat, Batman.\n\nI rescued Batman from the streets of Harlem about three and a half years ago, and since we've formed a very close bond. I'm sure you fellow cat lovers can understand the feeling of a cat loving you more than it loves anybody else. I feel bad about keeping him away from the outdoors, so I'm trying to think of a way to give him a little taste of it. We don't have a fire escape, so the only way to go outside is to use the indoor staircase.\n\nMy boyfriend's solution is just to keep him inside, and maybe we can if I had a way to install a window perch (or something like that), but I've seen how much good it's done for Batman to let him go outside everyday. He used to be a very aggressive cat, but in the year we've lived her, I've seen him play with neighboring two-year-olds. I'm concerned that keeping him cooped up inside will lead him back to his aggressive nature.\n\nDo you guys have any advice for me? I appreciate any words you may have.  Thank you!",

My 7 year old obese brown Tabby (adopted 1.5 years ago) doesn't use the litterbox...we've ruled out anything medical and have taken him to the vet and had a multitude of tests done. The vet's opinion is that it is behavioral and likely, in part, due to his large size (27 lbs). He's on a special metabolic and urinary food, but the weight loss process has been slow. Do any of you all have any tips on how to relitterbox train? Has anyone been through this? Research is showing me that it takes about 2-3 weeks in an isolated room with food, water, and the litterbox. Is there a way to ensure success? Thanks!",

They have great personalities, and I love them very much.\n\nUnfortunately, due to a break up, poverty, and housing issues, neither I nor my ex can take them. \n\nIt would break my heart to put them in a shelter or separate them.\n\nWe are in the Philadelphia area. I can drop them off to you. I don't want money, I just want to know that these guys will have a loving home and will stay together.\n\nThey are both neutered. They have never hurt a soul. They love to wrestle each other. Morris likes to play with dogs, Huxley loves to be treated like a dog. They have spent most of their lives as indoor cats, but they have some experience outdoors and would probably make good indoor/outdoor cats. They still have their claws but don't really claw at furniture very often. They are warm, friendly, curious, and affectionate, independent and not needy. They are great lap cats and cuddlers, and great with people and children.\n\nHere's an album to show you what they look like. PM me for details.\nhttp://imgur.com/a/aGNU4",

He is stubborn, anti social and opinionated, but he can also be really affectionate when he wants to. I have been married to my husband for almost three years. He's never been a cat person (I've always had a cat) and they don't exactly play nice. My husband is a light sleeper and the cat meows quite loudly around 7 or 8 when he thinks it's breakfast time, no matter the day. I sleep through it, my husband can't go back to sleep. My cat has been overweight for a while so we decided to cut back on his food at the advise of our vet (maybe started a month ago). Now the cat meows constantly throughout the day and goes in the pantry and hops on the counters (rarely happened before) for scraps of food. I can see it taking a toll on my husband's well being and our marriage. I love my cat, but I love my husband more. Do I need to get rid of my cat? Is there something else I can do? (Obviously feeding the cat more food would pacify him but I that would not be healthy for him) Thanks in advance for any help or advise. \n\nTL:DR- my cat and husband are at odds and is taking a toll on our marriage.

    "description": "When I was 14, we lived on an old farm property in Minnesota, no farm animals, but we had a Dog and a few cats. Anyway, one day, my dad and I were outside in November, and we were underneath the trailer house, (we lived in a trailer home for a very long time), a  very small, wild cat just walked up to us, and she was very skinny. She looked like she was about to starve to death. \n\nWell, my dad had always hated cats, but I begged him to let me go get the cat some food, and he tols me to run inside and grab some milk and a can on mom's shitty tuna. I brought it outside and the cat ate the full can of tuna and drank all of the milk. \n\nThis cat, we named her Mini, as she was a runt compared to every other cat We'd ever seen. Anyway, after about a year she ended up having a litter of 5 kittens. We couldn't believe it, she was so small to begin with. At the end of her pregnancy she could barely move, she was so big. Well, 2 of those cats were born crippled, and 3 were born very healthy, and actually grew to be very healthy cats. \n\nOut of the 2 that were crippled, one was crippled much worse. She couldn't stand up without losing its balance and falling  over. She was very sick and getting sicker every day. Eventually, we ended up putting her down because we felt horrible watching it suffer. \n\nThe other cat that was born crippled was the beloved Flip-flop. Her left leg was crippled and it led to an amusingly adorable lifetime of this specific cat. When she ran, she couldn't keep herself running straight, so she would start running sideways until she stumbled and fell over. She also didn't run anywhere close to how a cat would normally run. She ran more like a deer. Her back legs FLEW up Into the air, because she had little control over it. \n\nShe was a black/gray cat with a white belly and legs, with shiny blue eyes. She was the most lovable little bugger ever. She was also a runt, just like her mother. \n\nWell she got pregnant a couple different times. Her first batch of kittens were stillborn. She was just too messed up at birth and the kittens didn't survive the birthing process. Her 2nd batch was a very healthy little group of kittens though. They were a fiesty little bunch. They all looked exactly the same as Flip-flop. \n\nI really wish I had pictures of my old cat. We gave it away to my sister and her boyfriend when my family and I moved, but when they broke up, her boyfriend killed it. Not a happy ending whatsoever, but Flip-flop will always be my favorite cat ever, and I just figured maybe reddit could appreciate such a great cat. ",

As soon as it happened I ran and drove her to the 24 hour vet(It was about 11 at night). they gave me all the proper medication for her and wrapped both her paws up and gave her a cone. The vet said she could have 3rd degree burns on her front paw. within 2 minutes of being home, she had the front wrap off. I took her back to the vet today, and the same thing happened. I salvaged the wraps this time and so far I've rewrapped it about 3 times in 4 hours. I honestly dont know what to do anymore. I know it needs to stay in a wrap to heal, but I'm worried they she will continue to get out of it. She gets really worked up about it, I assume from the pain as well as the discomfort of being  bound. I had to take work off just to sit with her today so I could supervise her. I'm terrified to leave her by herself because I need to go to work in the morning and there is no option for anyone else to watch her. What a terrible couple of days it has been. And painful meowing is so hard to listen to, it just bums me out. I'm not sure if anyone else has been in this situation, but any advice would really help me out. Thanks so much for reading. ",

Is this from the outdoors? What can I do about this? She hates water. She tolerates brushing. She grooms herself and eats a good diet. She's never had a stank before and now when she cuddles me it's unpleasant for my nose and as she sleeps with me, it's making the blankets smell.",

    "description": "Hi, I have 4 cats at home (they are not all mine but we are 4 people in a big apartment and everyone has his own cat) but they gained way too much weight in the past few months. They started gaining weight after neutering, we are giving them good food for neutered cats, but they seem to gain more and more weight. I do play with them but it's not enough. This kind of scares me. I really don't know what to do. Should I change the food, to give them food for obese cats, or I don't know??",

    "description": "I have 2 cats; Siblings, about or a bit over a year old, both are strictly indoor and have been for the most part well-behaved.\n\nThe sister has been the more pensive of the two (brother is incredibly lazy and chill), and is affectionate, but only on her terms. If you are sitting she will come up to be pet and so on but tends to keep distance if you're standing.\n\nRecently the she has started meowing/yowling quite loudly. She's always been fairly low-pitched but quiet so I can't say its lower pitched than \"normal\" but it certainly seems more distressed. She'll usually go in to the empty hallway and start meowing loudly. When I walk over to her she runs off but STILL meows, and on occasion will just stand in the middle of the living room and meow. I'd figure this was something medical and would get her looked at (I still will just in case), but she DOESN'T do any of this when she's in the bedroom (a room she normally isn't allowed in). When in there she's her usual self and quiet and content to sit or lie down, but the instant I walk her out of the room she starts the meowing thing up again. She doesn't stand at the door meowing, generally nowhere near it.\n\nNothing has changed as far as the layout of the house is concerned that I know of, no new furniture or noises, no new devices, no changes to climate/temperature. Everything is the same as before. She doesn't have any clear signs of pain or injury.\n\nIts been going on about 2 weeks so far and nothing useful turns up online. I'll still be taking her to get checked out when I have 2 cents to rub together, but I just wanted to know if there was something I should be looking out for that isn't obvious.",

[This is my second cat and she was about 3 when I got her; my older cat is 11 so I have some cat experience] When I adopted her the foster family had given me their email and asked if I could send a few pictures of her in her new home, which I didn't mind doing at all and so recently I forwarded them a few pics. However the response I received from them was generally rude, and enough to cause a first time cat owner to panic a bit (luckily this is not my first cat and so I am taking the comments a little less seriously). The comments they made included things such as:\n\n-The collar is dangerous, if she jumps she can get stuck, hang herself up an die {it is a safety collar that will release, and was also only on her as she had been to the vet that day and I like them to have a collar on when I take them out, just in case of an escape}\n\n-She should not wear nail caps as they will give her back problems, maybe she doesn't have those problems yet but she will if you keep using them {I have discussed the caps with multiple vets and am comfortable that they will not cause issues, and in any case she only had them for a short period while I made sure that her and my resident cat would not attack each other, and that she would not tear up the carpet}\n\n-She looks fat and this will cause health issues {She was just at the vet and she 1. weighs the same as when I adopted her and 2.Is a healthy weight, she is a very fluffy cat so maybe this is why she though she looked fat?}\n\n-Cats are not dolls that you can dress up anyway you like {I do not feel that a collar on a cat is equivalent to me dressing her up like a toy}\n\n-If you would let the cat live more naturally she would be happier\n\n*To be clear the portions in {brackets} are my own responses\n\nThe response I got was from the foster family and not the organization and I am wondering if I should bring it up to the organization? Or if my beliefs are way off and I should actually listen to what the foster family said?\n\nFor further clarity these are the pictures that they are talking about:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/yYarc\n",

    "description": "Back story:  I started noticing this very skinny kitten that seemed to come and go around our house.  We live in a small city area where it is pretty busy.  We started trying to leave food out for it, but the rest of the cats around would come by and eat it.  Eventually the kitten started staying under a bush right out front of our house, so we were able to keep placing food there as we tried to gain her trust.  One night it was raining and 40 degrees out and I saw her shivering under the bush, so my wife and I are trying to corner her to come into the crate.  It wasn't working as she would just run away, but we kept up with it for an hour or so with no luck.  Overnight we kept our screen door open with the crate just inside with food inside the crate.  In the morning, she was in there! So my wife quickly shut the door and we got her!\n\nSo, we brought her to the vet and got all the necessary shots and were told to keep her quarantined for 10 days just in case she had rabies and to let the flees die off.  This is also where we learned it was a girl.\n\nNow she stays in our front room that we use for storage.  It has been a little over a 5 weeks since we saved her.  She still is very scared of us to come near her, she always scurries away to a spot she feels safe.  \n\nThough, she has come a long way because my wife was able to stay in the room while she ate a ways away.  And if we put the food out, she will come right out and eat once the door is shut.  \n\nShe also is pooping on the floor quite a bit.  But, we just got a covered litter box that seems to be helping with that some.\n\nAny advice on what we could be doing better?  My wife has been doing the best she can with trying to talk on the phone in the room and things so she gets acquainted.  But, I could see how the poor girl is so scared because all in one day she was captured and then had shots that were not too much fun.\n\nThanks for any help, sorry for the long read! ",

I've always wanted a cat, but my father is super allergic plus he probably would have never allowed it anyway. I've always rented in placed with no pets because it is usually cheaper.\n\nWell me and my fiancee just bought our house back in July. We have hit a bit of a rough patch (not us as a couple, just life in general) and we've both been rather depressed. Thankfully I have an exciting new dream job, but unfortuantely my fiancee just LOST her job as well as finding out her mother is moving, with whom is is incredibly close.\n\nThe other day she mentioned someone had kittens up for adoption, but we couldn't afford it at the time, but the idea definitely resonated with me... Then, as if serindipidy is a real thing, a friend posted on Facebook that her cats just had a litter of seven(!!!) kittens. She wanted to keep them, but a total of fourteen(even more !!!!) was just too much for her. She decided that she was going to give one away. I had read that it isn't a good idea to break them up and have a solo kitten in the house, but I still decided to contact her. I figured it wouldn't hurt to at least look into it. Well when I talked to her, she mentioned the one she named Tiger (a very colorful one opposed to the rest of them who were black and white) was her absolute favorite and was the only one that she would NOT get rid of.\n\nWell I grew very attached to one of them as he immediately came to me and wouldn't leave me alone, so I decided what the heck...  after a few minutes she asked \"Hell, would you take two of em?! As much as I don't want to, I cannot keep seven new kittens, and I'd really hate to break them up.\"\n\nShe graciously let me take Tiger, and I became so absolutely excited to bring them home to my future wife. She was so happy she started crying. She told me how ever since she moved out of her moms, she was also very sad because she misses her dog as well as her cat of 10 years who they had to put down.\n\nI was still a little nervous, my friend told me they were both realtively potty trained and are eating well with very little help, so in her words 'they are going to be very, very good pets\".\n\nStill, I'm a worrier, but when I arrived home from work, all my worries went away. They both came out from hiding and came right to me, showing off telling me they wanted to play. My fiancee and I have been on the floor the entire time, giggling our butts off, the only break I've taken in 4 hours is to do this because I'm so excited to finally have cats to call my own.\n\nSorry for the super long post, but I am just too gosh darn excited. I've lived with pets before, but they were never actually mine nor entirely my responsibility. I always helped out, sure but finally, they are MINE. I'm most likely going to be going the whole week without sleep because I won't be able to stop playing and taking pictures.\n\nOh, and we cannot forget posting here. For all that sweet, sweet karma that is headed my way! ;P",

We took her to the vet, they gave her antibiotics, put on an e-collar, gave us Composure chews and sent us our way after a $300 bill for the check up, an x-ray (to check if her tail is broken - it wasn't), and all the medication and treats. \n\nBut that was a month ago. Now my baby has an e-collar on day in and day out. I try to take it off when I'm home and supervising but it's still on for the majority of the time. I've tried 'weaning' her off the collar but anytime I've left her unsupervised without the collar I come back to the same scene of blood everywhere. To add to this, the e-collar has given her a nasty case of blackheads under her chin. \n\nI don't know what to do! I can't afford to keep going to the vet for expensive tests and they don't seem to be taking the bull by the horns either. The mentioned starting her on anti-anxiety medication or something for OCD.

    "description": "My S.O. and I broke up almost 2 months ago. He was usually here all day with my cats. Since he has been gone it has been nonstop meowing. And not just meowing but deep howling meows. It happens all hours of the day and wakes me up multiple times a night. I have tried cuddling and comforting, but 10-15 minutes later it begins again. I'm starting to lose my shit. Has anyone else experienced this and did anything help? I feel so bad for them but it's getting ridiculous. They have a bond with me too. But apparently the bond was stronger with him? I dunno.  And he is not in the position right now to take them so that's out of the question",

    "title": "Cat peeing problem, need some help from the cat experts.",
    "description": "Hey guys, I need some advice or help on a current problem me and my cat are facing. I'll start from the beginning and go from there. I got a savannah cat about 4 years ago, raised him as a kitten and never once had any issues with him peeing or pooping outside his litter box. When raised he also lived with another black female cat who didn't like to play with him but also never attacked him. About a year ago I moved into an apartment with me, a roommate and my savannah cat. At the new apartment he still used his litter box fine and had no issues. Well about 4 months into the apartment my roommate had to relocate his cats(2 male pixie bobs) from England as his ex-gf could no longer take care of them. When the cats arrived my cat didn't really like them and was wary, while the other 2 were terrified of the new environment. 2 weeks later the new pixie bobs started venturing out from my roommates room to the living room and exploring more. Which where the problem began, I guess my first fault was I left his litter box in the living room where the other cats would hang. The cats would try to play with him but he would get scared of them and run away every time. Which then I didn't catch he was too afraid to go in his litter box till it was too late. I come to find he started to pee in my room in the corners and on my clothes plus a bag that was very expensive :( When I found out I quickly moved his litter box near my room around the corner, which was not in the living room. And I also picked up everything in my room and made sure nothing was left on the ground. He then would still poop in his litter box but then began peeing on the couch in the living room and continued to do so. I then took the cushions off the couch and kept them off to prevent him from peeing on them, but he still would pee on the couch supports. So then I tried just keeping him in the bathroom while I was out but that didn't help very much and he only rarely peed in the box, he still had the bad habit of going for the couch. Still dealing with the problem I ended up moving out of the apartment 6 months later and had to leave the country for work. I couldn't bring my cat with me so I left him at my parents while I was gone. We put him downstairs in the basement area where the pool room was, so he could be secluded for a little while and get adjusted. I figured the other cats were causing him to not use the litter box properly and that he would go back to normal. Well he then started to pee on my parents pool cover and also in the corners of the pool area. Which at some point my parents tried putting him in the laundry room and he began to pee on the hard lament floors. I don't understand how to break his bad pee habit and it seems everything I try doesn't work. I also added 2 more litter boxes in the pool area and he's still peeing on the cover and corners. I clean up the messes with special cat pee treatment every time and make sure his litter boxes are clean and maintained as well. I've noticed he poops in the corner original litter box he's had since a kitten all the time, with an occasional pee. And the 2 new litter boxes he does not poop in them at all but sometimes pees in them. But I still have to clean up his accidents from time to time. Is there anything I can do to fix this? I heard of feliway but not sure how it works and what to do. Also I apologize for any grammar issues above hah.\n\n\nUpdate: Took him to the vet and the urinalysis turned up negative, so the vet thinks its definitely a behavioral issue. He gave me some stuff to mix in his kitty litter and told me to get unscented so he can smell it. He also recommended feliway which I will try if the new litter additive doesn't work. Keep you all posted :) thanks!",

    "title": "My cat is sane and my roommate is not.",
    "description": "So I have a kitten, he's about 3 months old by now, and I love him. However, I live with a Korean girl who is absolutely obsessed with cleaning; she can't stand that the cat's butt hole isn't shinning, so she cleans the cat's ass more often than I'd like to tell. She says the cat feels uncomfortable when she is doing it, and that he is still fighting her. I haven't asked her how she does it, or what kind of cleaning products she uses (this is a girl who cleans clean things just to see how cleaning products work their magic, as she has told me). Anyways, I suppose that doesn't harm, but she was telling me how she has had talks with the cat about why it's important for him to have a clean butt. To me that sounds crazy. This is the first time we have cats in our lives, we both had dogs growing up, so I'm as inexperienced as her when it comes to my kitty. She has suggested I bathe the cat more often than once a month (he's an indoors cat, never ever goes outside). But what bothers me is that I've seen her slapping the cat around. \n\nDoes it really work to hit the cat on his back to prevent him from coming to your food? Sometimes when he tries to climb to the kitchen counter, I'll hit his head, but not hard. However, I think my roommate slaps the cat way more often than I do; she's told me \"she's the one who hits him\", since according to her, I'm too lenient with him.\n\n\n\nHow can I explain to her that no amount of punching him will stop him from trying to eat her food? and how can she clean the cats butt without maybe causing him a rash or something?\n\n\nEDIT: You people make it sound like I'm abusing my cat. For everybody's information, I rescued the cat from a informal shelter owned by a guy who loved animals enough to pull them off the streets, but who earned just about to survive. He was full of ring worms, which by the way, both my roommate and I caught. I bathed him the day he came to our home, and took him to the vet straight away. The skin medication he got, stuck to his ears and made him uncomfortable, so I bathed him again. That's two fucking baths in two months. And he will not be taking any other bath until his ears are 100% fine. \nFor those saying I shouldn't own a cat or I should read wikipedia to inform myself about cats, guess what? I already did, long ago; I've watched shows, read, and my boyfriend has had cats his whole life and has taught me a lot. That's why A) I NEVER EVER HIT my cat; B) I don't overly clean him and C) the cat is well fed, he has 2 different kinds of food, plus vitamins to help him become healthier, and by now, he is; he also has plenty of toys, a bed, and a clean litterbox, he is properly taken care of and enjoys play time. So don't fucking tell me I can't own a cat or that I know nothing just because I'm asking a question anonymously. Can't you really understand that I'm researching even more for my cat's well being? DUH; I'm coming here for extra advise on something, that's what this site is for. My roommate is not leaving until next year, and the cat is staying. No, he will not die, nor will he become an unsocial awful cat as you guys think. Enough of my friends come to my place and he gets extra attention and extra play time. So yeah, about hating humans... not gonna happen.  \nHeyGrrrrrrl was basically the only person who was able to actually provide an useful insight and a solution. The rest of you thank you, but no thanks. If you're just here to criticize and overreact, please don't even comment, go and work on yourselves, before you try and give an advise. \n",

    "description": "First, I would like to say most of everything I have read on cats' behavior problems usually stem from how the human interacts with the cat. My cat, a two year old tiger tabby cat named Pippin, always bites people. His bites aren't very hard and won't draw blood. Nevertheless, they are still very uncomfortable, and my guests aren't able to relax around him. Pippin likes to be around people and will even sit on or touching someone. If they take this as a sign to start petting Pippin he will bite or claw at them. I feed Pippin regularly so I feel like it isn't a problem with his diet and he gets freshwater very often (2-3 times daily). I also keep his liter box very clean. I have tried to play with him but no matter what I do he seems to get bored. He isn't comfortable going outside to let out some energy. Pleaaaaaaseeee some sound advice would be awesome. I want to someday have a family and I would hate it if I had to get rid of him because of his behavior issues that I may or may not be able to influence. \n",

    "title": "Help for a constantly peeing cat.",
    "description": "I am desperately seeking help for my 8 year old cat. I used to live alone with her and one other cat for several years. I had to move back home a year ago (long story) and unfortunately am going to be here for a while. The problem is she's one of about four cats in the house and has taken to peeing on everything.\n\nThis is not new for her. It's something she's done since I got her, but when I lived with her I modified my lifestyle (cotton bedding only, no mess, minimalist furniture, etc) to accommodate her behavior. I know she pees out of spite, but also for varied and unknown reasons. We did have incidents of her peeing on furniture when I lived alone, but they were not as frequent and I had long periods where she did not pee on anything.\n\nI have had her urine tested multiple times, including most recently two months ago, to make sure it isn't a medical issue. The vet has found no crystals, and based on the content doesn't believe my cat has either kidney issues or diabetes.\n\nWe have five litter boxes in several places, use the brand of litter I picked out because its the one she seems to prefer, and she has a pheromone collar. We're installing a feliway plug in our dining room because that's where she pees most.\n\nWhen I see its a problem, she pees on everything. Beds, clothes, the rug (we had to replace an area rug because the smell was so bad). Part of the issue is my mother is a messy woman with piles of stuff everywhere. I personally think the cat is more important than the stuff, and would rather modify how I live and see if that makes it better than get rid of the cat. My mother does not feel the same, and I have been desperately fighting to keep her and fix the problem. The only solutions I feel I have left are rehoming and a behaviorist, and I am very much strapped for cash. It has been suggested, because she is a very sweet, timid, affectionate cat, that she may be a one cat house. She also terrorizes the youngest and smallest cat to the point that cat largely lives in a room on the second floor (we've had to put food and a cat box in there because she won't leave if she can smell my cat).\n\nI need help, because I love my cat and don't know what else to do. I am especially scared of trying to rehome her, because I know all too well what happens to problem animals in new situations, and the last thing I want is my baby to end up alone in a kill shelter.\n\nThis is two pronged: if any one knows what to do to help my cat, any and all suggestions are welcome! I can usually calm my mother when she says the cat has to go, but what my cat ruins is only getting worse and its usually her stuff. If, however, you think a new home may be best and you or someone you know has experience with this situation and know where to find her the *best* forever home that would handle this, that is helpful as well. But I would much prefer to keep my cat.",

    "title": "Young cat (8months) is showing negative behavior in regard to feeding (growling, hissing and crying for more food).",
    "description": "tl;dr: I have two cats, 8 months and 2 yrs.  the 8mo has recently started hissing and growling during feeding and attempts to stop the behavior are ineffective.\n\nI have a pair of cats named Elliott (appx. 2yo) and Thunder (8mo).  The pair are getting along famously and are a couple of the best cats a new owner could have possibly asked for.  Without gushing too much, which I tend to do when it comes to my boys, I adopted Elliott as a stray last 4th of July when he came to the door afraid of the fireworks, and Thunder I picked up with my girlfriend from the Michigan Humane Society as a 6-week-old kitten.  \n\nThe two had the usual disputes that come about with a new cat, but they managed to put aside their differences and become loving brothers in an unprecedented 4 days.  Fast forward about 6 months, I've moved a couple times (temporary residences, but now am permanent for at least the next year) and i've had my share of income issues, but I've managed to go without my boys going hungry.  I figure, if I can't feed myself then I can go without food for a day, but they rely on me so I morally cannot let them suffer in such a way if it can be helped.\n\nNow, the problem that I'm experiencing right now, and have been for awhile, is that Thunder has a tendency to cry for food very loudly and regularly.  I'm not worried about the noise, since my neighbors aren't bothered or affected negatively by it, it's just a thing that happens.  It would be nice to mitigate it, but it's difficult to do so when he starts as I am getting food ready, so when I give it to them it's possibly reinforcing the behavior.  \n\nBut like I said, that's a minor issue.  The major issue, which has just started this past week, is that Thunder has become much more territorial/aggressive in regard to meals.  It started earlier this week when I ran out of cat food and I was without a car or a ride (closest pet store a 5-mile hike).  It wasn't too big a deal, I warmed up and cut up some hot dogs into nice, bite-sized bits and fed it to them (after testing a bit to make sure they would eat it) and I figured that all was well.  But after I turn my back, I hear Thunder hissing and growling at Elliott, who has no idea what to do and just starts backing away.\n\nI take Thunder and kennel him for a bit until Elliott has eaten his share, then I let him out and watch him while he eats his share.  He's staring down Elliott the whole time and even lets out a growl, to which I bop him in the side which stops it.  I thought that the situation was, for some reason, brought about from the hot dogs, and made a note not to feed it to them again.  I made calls and had my girlfriend pick up cat food on her way to the house that afternoon.\n\nBut since then, the behavior has been becoming more and more regular for Thunder, he has growled/hissed at Elliott even with normal food and has even started taking Elliott's food after devouring his own portions in record time.  I feed them each a half can of wet food each meal (morning, after work at 3PM and in the evening, three cans in total) which is what is recommended for their weight.  I used to feed Thunder more, but he's gotten full sized and should be fine with regular portions by now.\n\nI've tried a few different things this past week to help the issue.  I've tried picking him up by the scruff and telling him to stop, which worked just fine for his brother Elliott but not so much for Thunder since he goes right back to whatever he was doing when I put him down. I've tried watching them while they eat, but even with me right there Thunder acts up and I can't sit around for 10-15 minutes before work while they eat, I already get up at 430am as it is.  I've tried spraying him with water, but that just causes him to run away, lick it off and come right back for more.  I've tried nose-bopping, but that doesn't do hardly anything.\n\nI would really like a bit of advice on what to do, and I'll even take what-not-to-do's as well in case I'm making any mistakes here.  I'm very close to making a trip to the vet about the behavior as well, but I thought I'd ask the internet for some advice since giving Karma costs less than medical bills.  ",

    "title": "How much discipline is appropriate for cats/kittens?",
    "description": "I adopted two four month old sister kittens from the humane association about three months ago. I absolutely adore the sweet girls! They're super friendly and playful. Over the weekend, one of my friends confronted me that he thinks my kittens are out of control and need discipline. That I need to remind them that I am in control, not them. \n\nHere is the behavior he criticized: \n\n1) He has an old jacket with lots of threads hanging off. he hangs it on a chair and the kittens try to play with the thread. \nMy way of handling the situation: I offer to put his jacket in a room where the cats can't get it and distract them with other toys. \n\n2) They like to jump up on tables and counters. \nMy way of handling the situation: I let them. It doesn't bother me. \n\n3) They run around the apartment wrestling each other. \nMy way of handling the situation: I let them, unless it looks like they are getting violent. In that case I will clap loudly close by them- or if extreme, spray with a squirt bottle. \n\n4) They try to climb the Christmas Tree. \nMy way of handling it: I say \"NO!\" and move them off the tree\n\n5) They like to claw at the couches.\nMy way of handling it: I say \"NO!\" and move them to their scratching post. \n\nI chalked most of the behavior above to them being kittens. I know kittens are playful and like to wrestle, climb, play with string, etc. They're good at using the litter box and they never claw or bite people, so I just let them play and have fun and I hadn't thought much about discipline. \n\nBut based on my friend's comment, and the info above, do you all think I should discipline them more than I have been? If so, what tactics do you find works best for cats? I've read a lot about the spray bottle, but I try to use it minimally because they seem scared of me for an hour or so after I use it. What other tips do you all have for cat and kitten discipline? ",

    "description": "I do my best for my kitten Miss Cleo, she gets the best food money can buy and all the love/attention she wants when she wants it (emphasis on WHEN she wants it).  She is a terror though, has absolutely destroyed my leather couch and constantly attacks our feet when we walk around the house.  I have a heavy hand with the water bottle, wildly spraying her to get her off the couch and counters and away from my feet.  The water alone just stopped working, she doesn't care anymore about being sprayed she just stays put and takes it.  So, naturally I decided to step it up a bit and miz some vinegar in.  I started with a small mixture, perhaps 10% vin/90% water....that did nothing.  I upped it to about 40% vinegar/60% water.  Now we are seeking some results, she absolutely hates it and it's working a bit more effectively as a deterrent.  I've researched if it is safe, so i am not concerned that her licking the vinegar is going to harm her....I just wonder how the cat community feels towards this bad behavior technique.  Is it cruel to dowser her body with vinegar, often it takes her a good 10 minutes of licking to resume normal activity.  Are their better methods?  Is lemon water a better alternative?  I really don't know how to tame this wild creature.  ",

    "title": "My cat's awesome progress :) (no pics, just talking about my cat!)",
    "description": "Hi r/cats :) I wanted to tell someone just how excited I am about my cat, Miso's, health!\n\nWe moved from a larger house to a small apartment together when I started university this fall. She's 10 years old, no spring chicken, but still has a long life ahead of her, I think. When we moved, I was really worried about her health. She's been overweight for quite some time and hadn't been successfully losing weight, and was developing some arthritis in her knees. Miso was a total lap cat and cuddler, not very active most of the time, when we were living in a house. Moving someplace even smaller, I had no idea how she'd get enough physical activity to stay in shape.\n\nI've made quite an effort to keep the apartment full of surprises for her and encourage her to explore it. I hide and cycle through toys, put treats in (safe) crevices, and spend a good 15 minutes per day playing with her.\n\nI don't even know if all that was necessary - the transformation was immediate! We'd been living in a house with other animals before and I think that was just putting her under a lot of stress. We've had her since she was a kitten, along with her sister, but she would fight with her sister a lot no matter how many times we reintroduced them. Then, we got a dog, and she was very defensive towards him and extremely territorial about him being in my room.\n\nNow, she has the whole place to herself. She loves it, and explores and plays ALL THE TIME, with or without my help. She'll find anything to bat around and chew on. She's already lost half a pound in the three months we've been here and just generally seems so much healthier and happier. She doesn't \"act like\" a 10-year-old cat at all: she's got all the energy of a young adult!\n\nWhat a relief!! It's so cool to see her in full huntress mode now, stalking after pipe cleaners and shoelaces and coat sleeves. And she's still my snuggly baby too.\n\nI hope this is uplifting for anyone who is going to have to make a similar move with their kitty soon!",

    "description": "I have a 14 year old black cat. Always been good about using the litter box. About 2 months ago, he started going in the same spot near the basement door. I tried new litters, new boxes, using/not using the litter freshener, \"NO!\" spray, scrubbing the floor... you get the idea. \n\nAbout 3 weeks ago, I remembered that the last time he did this he had a UTI. \n\nI took him to a new vet (we moved 2 hours across town recently) and they kept him all day for a UA. I finally got a call from the doctor saying my cat was \"mean and showed cage aggression.\" This has NEVER been a problem before. (I asked if he bit or scratched anyone and was told no.) The Vet told me that there were no crystals in his urine but blood work pointed to a UTI so they gave me meds for him, gave him a rabies and distemper vaccine. I brought him home and he was covered in feces and couldn't walk up/down stairs for 24 hours. \n\nWe're now 2 weeks into the meds, he's having diarrhea. Still peeing/pooping in the floor. We decided to lock him in our bathroom with a clean box, food, and water so that he'd be away from our other cat (had her 1 year less than him, they're buddies) and maybe be \"forced\" to use the box. \n\n36 hours later, we let him out since he didn't go in the floor, and he's back to going in the basement floor again. I've put a call into our former vet, and quite honestly I'm going to drive the 2 hours to take him there if they think he needs to be seen again. \n\nAnyone have any advice to get my little shitting machine to go back into the box?

    "description": "I just need to write about my little boy for a second.  He and his brother came as a pair into the animal shelter where I work.  His brother was adopted by a family who took him and another kitten from another litter, they left my cat behind.  They didn't want to adopt my cat (Bryan) because he has a deflated eye, so he looks a little funny.  It doesn't hurt him at all.  I felt terribly for him, so I took him home, first as a foster, and now a foster failure. \n\nFast forward to today.  I was hanging around the house, getting ready for work, took a shower, was getting ready to feed them, no sign of Bryan.  I opened the cans...still not in the kitchen.  Then I saw him in the middle of the living room just hanging out on his cat bed.  Very unusual behavior.  So I put his food dish down and he got up and immediately both his hind legs kind of dropped to the floor.  I was worried he was paralyzed in the back.  He kind of waddled over and then started crying.  I panicked.  I called out of work and got him into the vet as quickly as possible.  The xrays showed a break in his growth plate in his little cat ankle.  Apparently the worst break of this kind the vet has ever seen.  UGH!!  I have no idea how he could have broken it unless something happened while I was in the shower.  \n\nAnyway, now I'm faced with the \"orthopedist or splint/cast\" option.  It has been suggested to me by a number of people that cat bones, especially in a young cat, do heal quite miraculously, and that the splint/cast might be the best option.  It's certainly the most (only) affordable one, but I dunno, I'm just sad and needed to vent and share and I'm hoping that someone here has had experience with a leg break that healed without issue. \n\nHe's locally Facebook famous, and by that, I mean he was featured in the \"13 Days of Catoween\" on my Facebook and has a devoted following of my friends, haha.  Here's a few pics of him to make you smile:  [Merry Christmas](http://imgur.com/VRY5I80) and [Hula Boy](http://imgur.com/QcJlcUO)",

    "description": "We have an 11 month old Bombay cat who can be a bit of a menace, recently he has picked up a habit of chewing on cables since I fell asleep and left a PS3 charge cable on the floor. He also has been chewing on the bottom part of the Christmas tree we have set up and jumping on counters, side tables, and dressers and is obsessed with messing with/knocking over my electronic cigarette to bat it around on the floor so it forces me to keep it in a drawer that he obsesses about getting onto/into.\n\n\nWe've tried many different common methods of curbing the behavior, from loud noises to yelling to spray bottle to swats on the behind when he doesn't see us catching him doing something wrong, we've even tried citrus scent/juice and tabasco around the tree and he loves it! Can't get enough of tabasco or lemon/orange juice so that didn't work as expected at all. He loves playing with tin/aluminum foil and it will entertain him for hours, tape is another toy for him he will constantly bat at it until it comes off and then he will play with it. He has plenty of toys to keep him entertained as well as a large and tall cat tree to climb and sleep in but they cant keep his interest for too long and he gets back into doing things he knows hes not supposed to do. We also keep him in the bedroom with us when we go to bed to keep him from getting into things while we sleep.\n\n\nHe is usually calm when I get home from work, but during the day while my wife is home he is all over the place doing everything he can to drive her insane, if neither of us are home (Camera) he just lays around and doesn't get into anything he knows hes not supposed to.\n\nWe're near our wits end and would really appreciate some advice on how to get him to stop this destructive behavior!",

    "title": "8 year-old cat suddenly misbehaving! Why?",
    "description": "My little sweetheart has a history of changing her personality, but the previous time it happened the reason was clear to me. She was always good with other cats, but due to an incident 4 years ago with a stray cat coming around and scaring the shit out of her (asshole cat would jump on the outside sill of the closed window, be aggressive and scare her while she was napping/relaxing on the inside sill) she became cat-aggressive and I had to separate her and my other, chill AF, cat.\n\nSo my sweetheart is *very* attached to me. In general she really loves people, is friendly, not shy or fearful with people, and after checking new visitors out, if she decides you're cool she will want you to pet her and such. 2 years ago I moved in with my now-fiance, who she loves. She will frequently choose his lap over mine when we are sitting with her. She snuggles him over me at night about half the time when he is home too. He works a job that sometimes sends him away from home for extended periods. Especially when he is gone, she is extremely attached to me.\n\nHe's been gone pretty much for the past 7 months after pretty much being home for over a year. He came home two weeks ago to stay for a while.\n\nFor the past couple weeks, she has been misbehaving in ways she never has before. She's still sweet and cuddly and loving towards both of us, but she's crying more frequently, begging for food constantly, jumping up on the counters, getting into the dirty dishes, stealing food (when she's never even been interested or fed human food, except for a few bits of turkey I rinsed off on Thanksgiving; I'll usually give her a bite or two at the holidays. I like for all our family members to have a little celebration!), and knocking over the trash and getting into it.\n\nShe isn't overweight. She's a healthy weight and I try to keep her there (although she was slightly overweight last winter, but we gradually fixed that). She acts like she's starving all of the time and her bad behavior makes me think she's hungry too. But, we feed her a whole can of wet food (half a can twice a day) and she gets a handful of crunchy treats every day, which I think should be enough for her, and she's been fine eating that for the past 9-10 months or so. She's a lazy kitty but not lethargic (energy level is normal) and she still loves to play. My fiance has been letting our dog in more often. She doesn't really like the dog but tolerates him. She definitely hates him way less than she hates the other cat.\n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated. I want my happy girl back! I'm tired of having to clean up after her bad behavior and my fiance shuts her away when she's being bad and she cries, which I can't stand. I don't want her to have to cry! That's my baby!",

    "description": "I hope this is ok. I see mostly pictures of cats and not much in the way of text threads so if I'm posting in the wrong location please let me know. \n\nMy fiance and I have 3 cats. A male that my fiance has had for about 5 years, another male that we adopted together about a year and a half ago, and then a female that we adopted back in August. All 3 are fixed and the two males absolutely love each other. \n\nThe new female had some trouble adjusting to the house when we first got her. She wasn't sure of the boys and they'd get into small fights (mostly just hissing, chasing, swatting), but it was never anything serious. She also hadn't seen dogs before so she would hiss and swat at our one dog. Both of these habits have VASTLY improved in the past few months. I haven't seen her hiss/swat at the dog in at least a month, and although there are still some disagreements with the boys it's much less common and generally just involves some hissing. \n\nI noticed about 2 weeks ago that there are a few spots in the house where it appears that a cat has sprayed. I don't know which cat is the culprit but it seems to be a recent development. As a result, I have 2 questions.\n\n1) Does anyone know of any products or have a secret recipe to get the smell out of the carpet? I've been using various Nature's Miracle products (that I previously had excellent results with) including a cat-urine specific spray, as well as shampooing that carpet area with their carpet shampoo. I've also tried straight up soaking the area with Nature's Miracle but I can still smell the urine afterwards. \n\n2) How do I prevent future spraying? There are 2 litter boxes in the house, should we get a 3rd? There are also plenty of toys, cat perches, etc. \n\nAny help/advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

    "description": "I know they say not to give milk to kittens. I was thinking about mixing up some crushed tape worm tablets with butter to get my 4yo 16lb beast to eat them.

He'll lick the moisture, then leave the remaining 97.45% meat behind. Total waste. \n\nAlso, the bottle I bought came with 3 tablets. The directions say cats more than 11lbs should have 1.5 tablets.

    "description": "Hey, /r/cats!\n\nScully, my 17 month old Siamese girl, has never had a problem using the litter box. I got her when she was about three months old and she never had a single accident, up until about two weeks ago. About a month ago we moved into a new house with two roommates and their dog (she doesn't care for dogs but has lived with them for most of her life). Her litter box is in my room. About ten days ago she peed on the couch which I cleaned up as best I could, and then the other day we found where she'd peed at least once on my roommate's wetsuit (which, in her defense, had been lying damp on top of a box in a corner storage room that no one really frequents). Finally this morning I was told that she peed on a damp pair of my roommate's tennis shoes. She's currently sequestered to my room until I can work something out with my roommates. I clean her litter box every day, occasionally ever two days if I'm super busy, but it's never out of control. \n\nOne thing I can note is that she only pees in the very front part of her litter box which is frustrating to me because every day the front part gets saturated and doesn't clump which makes cleaning grosser/more difficult. \n\nAny advice on why this may have started and what I can do about it?\n\nThanks!",

    "description": "Hi Reddit! I'm relatively new here so apologies if this isn't where this post should go.\n\nI moved into my apartment with my kitten this past August and he's now about 7 months old. He's the most wonderful kitten - he loves knocking things off of the counter, flipping his water bowl over, sleeping on my face, and all those other cat things that make him frustratingly lovable. :) About a month ago (October/November) my roommate brought home a laser light from work and he absolutely LOVED it. Maybe a little too much....\n\nThe laser has since been retired (partially because it ran out of battery, but also because we noticed he was a bit obsessed), but he has since taken up an extreme fascination with light reflections on the walls and ceilings. Lights from watches, jewelry, laptops, reflective surfaces...if it makes a light spot on the wall, he is there, chattering in frustration, sometimes for hours. Just staring at it.\n\nIt breaks my heart to see him so frustrated and obsessed. I've looked around on the internet, but all my googling is able to turn up is buzzfeed articles about '20 ways to know you're obsessed with your cat.' Is there anything I can do to help him break this habit?",

    "description": "I have an ~8.5 year old Siamese who's the love of my life. This guy is beyond rad. About two months ago, he'd wake up at about 3am making sounds like he was having a hairball but nothing would come up. It sounded almost like feline asthma but his gums were still pink and he didn't show any other symptoms. Then he started throwing up about an hour after eating with big chunks of food that looked like they weren't digesting. I showed the vet a video of I took of him and he was but on antibiotics and the coughing stopped as did the puking. Awesome. I should also add that his personality didn't change at all during this time and he was his normal playful, cuddly self. Especially with our younger cat.\n\n\nTwo days ago, he started walking to the litter box, squatting like he was going to pee, but didn't. No yowling like he was in pain or anything like that, just sitting in there like he was waiting. I immediately called the vet and brought him in about 15 mins later. He had a shot and was prescribed a urinary food and Clavamox. I took him home and he didn't use the bathroom that night and I brought him back the next day while I was at work so they could keep an eye on him. He did end up peeing there (in their words a crazy amount) and when I brought him home he's been peeing regularly since. I called today about the urine test they did and there was blood in it but no crystals, etc. Last night he was asleep in my lap and he head went entirely limp. I panicked and shook him, fearing the worst, and he jolted awake and meowed at me like I'd just ruined his day. I was terrified but I think it was just that he'd had a rough day and was completely zonked out. I don't know if I'm overreacting and panicking over nothing, but I'm just scared there's something underlying that hasn't been discovered. He did have bloodwork two months ago and everything looked great. My family has had two unexpected pet losses in the last six months and I think that's getting to me as well. \n\nAnyway, I'm sorry for this long description. I'm looking for some peace of mind or at least maybe some advice. This guy has been through a lot with me and I want his quality of life to be the best that it can. Thanks, everyone. ",

I'm a dental student and check his teeth often myself, they always look very clean and healthy.

    "description": "Hey there fellows\n\nStory time : \n\nI have two siberians. The first boy was 4 months old when we got him, number two followed up a month later and he was 3 months old. Biggie (or Ajani, older kitten) weighs a whooping 4.2 kg now, and ozy (younger kitten) just about half. The introduction took two weeks and at week three they are hanging out together, sleeping together, grooming and sweet and playful.\n\nSo far really great! Biggie measures his power to ozy, most of the time... And sometimes things get really wild. He got more casual and confident, now he sometimes tripps the line. Biggie roughs up ozy, ozy screams and growls and hisses then and fends him off as much as he can. I see biggie being in hunting mode, then in play mode, in and out. He really goes for the little one. When Ozy has made his point (which takes a lot of hiss and growl) biggie is confused, makes friendly purr-meows (mmmrrrrrrrrreow!) and lays down with a bit distance. I feel ozy being quite roughed up cause he hasn't gotten thick furr yet. Punctures here and there, i see furr bitten out of both cats on the couch. But still when I seperate them, ozy calls desperately for biggie. He will go provoking another round when I open the door, while biggie is more passive. Biggie NEVER hisses or growls. But in bad situations his ears are back and bites hard enough to make little scree a bit.\n\nI play with them for an hour every day too. It still happens. Should I worry that this might lead to them developing issues or let them figure it out? Also after those fights biggie keeps calling, he calls when he can't find ozy (cause he went hiding and had enough), and inbetween, before and after playing/chasing. It's a friendly call too. No yowling, no growls. \n\nAfter all of this, they are okay together again. All drama for nuthin'! Should I even break them up? I really only go in if ozy's hissing and screaming isn't stopping anymore. Looks rough but he always seems fine and not much scared.\n\nExperiences and ideas to help the peace here are welcome. \n\nHere are some photos of the trouble makers\nhttp://m.imgur.com/a/ZlTv7\n",

    "title": "Do I let my roommate adopt my cat, or do I take him with me?",
    "description": "A little backstory: I've had my five year old cat for almost two years now. I adopted him with my now ex-boyfriend but I became the sole caretaker plus the cat was quite attached to me anyways.\n\nThis past August I finally moved out and into another apartment with an old friend who also had a cat. Initially I was concerned as to how the two would get along because her cat was at her sisters over the summer and was spraying everywhere (mainly due to the fact that her sister had two other cats and a dog). My cat has previously lived with two small dogs so I wasn't sure how he would react to living with a cat myself. The first meeting was quite hostile with the cats hissing and staying apart in different rooms so we decided to get a cat pheromone diffuser to put them at ease. It worked like a charm and they were quickly the best of friends. The diffuser ran out after a month so we decided to see how they did without it and there was no major change, they were still quite friendly towards one another.\nIt's been three months without the pheromone and they're now practically inseparable. They play, cuddle, and clean each other, hell they even share food. They're both males so we're quite surprised that they took such a liking to one another.\n\nSo now this is where my predicament comes into play, my roommate asked me the other day if she could adopt my cat. I'm away from the apartment a good chunk of the week because I spend the weekends with my boyfriend who lives almost an hour away. If all goes according to plan I'll be moving out in August and moving in with him. He's not really a cat person but he's in no way hostile or malicious towards my cat, he's just not particularly warm (and he doesn't seem to keen on the idea of having a litter box in his small place). He's told me flat out that he doesn't want me to get rid of the cat so I know I have his support no matter what I decide.\n\nMy main concern is for the cats, my roommates cat has never been warm towards another animal the way that he is with mine. I worry that separating them would devastate the both of them, but I worry that separating myself from my cat would be just as bad. However he's already used to me being gone for 3-5 days at a time and if my roommate does adopt him I'll be able to come by and visit whenever I want.\n\nI need thoughts and opinions (hopefully leaning towards the understanding and nicer side...I'm already torn up about this so please don't make me feel worse) this is a really big decision to make and I'm a bit lost.",

It comes and goes, as if it's related to something happening. There are no new cats in the house, her food is the same, she is free to roam about the house, etc. \n\nOur vet suggested getting fish oil and putting it in her food or water, but she wouldn't touch the stuff. We tried the calming kitty air freshener and that just made her sleep a lot more for a few days. The next step according to the vet is bitters on the cords, but I'm anxious about the whole liquid + electric thing. So I was hoping someone would have advice or has worked through a silar bad habit with their cat before. ",

    "title": "My kitten had all the problems and she came through it ok--yours will too! [WARNING: BOOK-LENGTH POST]",
    "description": "I just wanted to post this somewhere so that people who are going through the same thing I did can read something positive and normal.  My kitten had a ton of health problems after I got her, and I would just spend hours researching this on the web (not smart, I know), and I was so EXCITED when I saw an alternate voice from the psychos in the cat forums who was like \"My cat is fine now, it wasn't the end of the world.\"  So this is a way for me to add to that community.  My cat is fine now.  It wasn't the end of the world.  None of it was.  Yours will probably be too.\n\nI got the floof in August, about two months after my elderly cat died of lymphoma.  She came to me from a local rescue group--I had zero intention of adopting so quickly but the moment she made eye contact with me from her cage, I was pretty much done.  The day after I brought her home, I took her to my vet.  She wasn't eating much, but we figured it was just the transition from the shelter.  My vet said to watch her hydration and see what happened.  This was Saturday.  By Sunday, she was still refusing food, was lethargic and wouldn't play at all, felt warm to the touch, and was getting dehydrated.  My vet advised me to take her to the emergency vet immediately.  They told me (after an obscene amount of money) that she had a severe upper respiratory infection, that she needed IV (NOT sub-q) fluids, and that she'd be hospitalized overnight until she could see a specialist.  The next day, the specialist calls and says she needs long term hospitalization.  My vet offered to keep her during the day and give her fluids and nutrition, but the emergency vet told me she was going to die if I did that.  Literally they said that and brought up EUTHANASIA.  I made the decision to bring her back to the rescue and see what they could do.  They kept her for two weeks, giving her fluids and feeding her, and just generally providing her with amazing care.  And guess what?  I got her back.  And she was fine!  On medication, but fine.\n\nSince then, floof and I have gone through a lot, because her immune system was so beat up at the emergency vet, she basically picked up everything.  She has had and come through:\n\n1) URI, for which the treatment was basically tender loving round-the-clock care and also clavamox, and definitely her most serious ailment\n2) Giardia (panacur)\n3) Coccidia (metronidazole)\n4) Bartonella (azithromycin)\n5) Ringworm (more below), and\n6) Tritrichomoniasis Foetus (more below).\n\nThat's a lot of things.  And again, fine.  \n\nThe ringworm experience is actually what prompted me to write this.  If your cat has ringworm and you ended up here, STOP GOOGLING.  The forums will tell you that you're definitely going to get it, that your house is going to be forever tainted with the ringworm, and that your cat will never get better.  This is just simply NOT TRUE.  My cat took itraconazole for 4 weeks and it went away completely.  I didn't bathe her.  I didn't clean my house.  I didn't get ringworm.  Yes, I understand that some cases are worse but the key is that NOT ALL OF THEM ARE.  Take a breath.  You'll get through it.\n\nThe tritrich has also been a long and windy road.  We treated, as you can see from above, for like all of the normal stomach problems, but floof still wasn't pooping normally (sorry TMI).  It got so bad I had to lock her out of my bedroom for awhile so she wouldn't stain my linens.  Luckily, I have a really great and patient vet who worked with me to find the real cause.  It was tritrich and if your cat has liquid poop and is negative for other things, it's almost definitely that.  It took TWO rounds of ronidazole to cure her.  The internet is also extremely scary about ronidazole because it can have neurological effects.  Floof had two rounds and was totally fine both times.  I kept an eye out, which mainly involved playing with her constantly to check motor skills, but she was good to go.  Don't freak out if this happens to you, either.\n\nToday, she's a healthy and normal six month old kitten.  She's a grade-A snuggler and she's super smart--she has learned how to sit, shake, give high 5s, get in her carrier, and we're working on her jumping through hoops.  She's seriously the best cat I've ever had and worth all the work and money.  That said, I couldn't have done this without working with amazing people--both the rescue organization and my vet deserve major commendations.  If you're in the New Orleans area, DM me and I'm more than happy to sing their praises.  I'll also be happy to talk about the horrible awful never-again emergency vet through DM if you'd like.\n\nAnyway, here are [some photos](http://imgur.com/gallery/OyJPo).  You've earned them for sticking with me this long.\n\nTL/DR: Kitten had URI, giardia, coccidia, bartonella, ringworm, and tri trich and came through all ok; the internet is full of scary exaggerations; calm down.",

    "description": "My cats are both 11.  We are putting them down because they keep peeing outside of the litter box. This has been an ongoing problem. They no longer live at our house because they were peeing in the basement on and off for years. One cat is prone to bladder infections and would associate the box with pain and go outside and the other would copy. We would treat the bladder infection, but the peeing doesn't seem to stop. They are now shop cats at our business. They've been here for several months and have started peeing again. One of them starts peeing in a spot and then the other follows. We have tried everything to get them to stop. We have them on the C/D food, four easily accessible litter boxes that are always clean. They don't have bladder infections (just went to vet). We use the cat attract litter. We have tried the pheromone air freshener plug in oil thingy and they have the pheromone collars on.  One of them stopped cleaning herself and seems to be shedding excessively so she is probably stressed out, but the vet can't find anything wrong with her.  We've racked up thousands in vet bills.  They had diarrhea for the last 6 months and that finally went away after 5 or so vet visits. They do go in there boxes part of the time and for whatever reason they go out part of the time. I'm not talking about peeing next to it. They find a spot and start going there.  We can't keep cleaning up urine and we can't seem to get them to go in their boxes. Any last bits of advice before we have them put down is appreciated. Keeping them outdoors isn't an option unless we build them some kind of fenced in area.  http://i.imgur.com/b9ZTVl6.jpg",

    "description": "So sometimes my cat will (and I'm only speculating on *how*) leave a small poop nugget on the floor, usually near the litter box, almost like she doesn't realize she has some out her bum and doesn't wait for it to fall? (Really sorry for that graphic.) Would a covered litter box help with that? She's not picky with litter type or box placement, but this thing happens only occasionally, and it's no fun to step in. She has no reason to be  startled out of the litter box as far as I can tell, as it's just her and me here. \n\nThe thing is, though, she has zero interest in cardboard boxes in general. She doesn't sit in, or hide in, or even acknowledge them. However, her latest favourite spot is under a chair in my living room, probably because it's right by the vent. \n\n**tl;dr: might a cat, who doesn't seem to care for enclosed \"secure\" spaces do better with a covered litter box? \n\nThoughts?

    "description": "Okay, so I'm a bit of a cat newb, but I'm looking to adopt.  One of the big things I'm worried about is the tendency of a cat to destroy stuff laying around your house.\n\nPrimary concern:  I'm building an airplane in my apartment (another long story...) the gist is I've got a decent amount of wood in my place that's in varying stages of airplane parts.  So, uhhh, do any cats show any tendency to want to like destroy stuff like that?  I figure I can keep the parts behind a closed door like 90% of the time, but not always.  I also figure that as long as the cat has sufficient toys/a scratching post/whatever else, he/she should be happy with those and not wanna fuck random shit up?\n\nAdditionally, how does a declawed cat play into this.  All I've heard about it is people passionate about not getting it done, and nobody I've talked to has really had much to say on the side of behavior as a result.  (I'm not gonna get one declawed, if it was something that might be beneficial I would adopt one that was already declawed.)\n\nSo, uhh, not sure how stupid this question is, but I figure better to ask a stupid question than be in over my head with a new best friend.",

    "description": "Hoping to get some input from you guys over here. Was out at our Christmas party tonight and had to come home because our cat Frankii is peeing blood. Little bits at a time in corners and against the wall. \n\nQuick back story, we became owners of the cat when he was around nine. Offered to take him for a couple months and the owner wouldn't take him back. He's now around 15 and in much better health than when we got him, but he was diabetic for a short period following steroid treatment for a vaccine reaction three and a half years ago. \n\nHe's on a mostly freeze dried raw diet and all was good until this evening. The vet suspects crystals or uti (quick checkup) but is advising a range of tests including urine analysis ($60) blood tests ($170) and xrays ($125). This is in Canada. \n\nMoney is tight, so we're stuck with some shit decisions. Gut feeling is to get urine analysis done and start on antibiotics before the blood test (vet said needed due to age) or xrays. If it was just the initial cost we could probably make it work but not much more than that. Frankii isn't showing symptoms of diabetes, so I've ruled that out. \n\nFollow up visit with vet in just under 12 hours, but any advice you have would be awesome. Thanks for taking the time to read this. ",

    "description": "Hey all! I've never been here before as I'm not a huge cat person (-gasp!-) but earlier tonight I got a call from my sister that a kitten they've been trying to catch at her workplace for about a month now finally was caught and she wanted me to go get it. \n\nI brought the kitten back home with me, peacefully managed to transfer her from the trapcage she was in to a large dog kennel (all I had), and inside there she has three blankets, a cardboard box (Reddit told me cats like those), a scratch arch, a water dish, and a food dish with cut up hotdogs and some leftover plain chicken breast from last night. Before you get on me about not giving her cat food, every shop in my town is closed right now and I wasn't exactly prepared for a kitten to come into my life, so that's the best I can do until tomorrow.\n\nSo..... what do I do now? I've given her a name already (Julian Drake) because every animal should have a name, and I'm leaving her alone in the kennel in a small bedroom so she can have some alone adjusting time. Am I doing the right thing? Where do I go from here? I've never had a cat and I don't know what the heck I'm doing but I want to do the right thing for her since before this she was living underneath a wooden palette in a cold winter.\n\nThanks in advance, and sorry for the wall of text!\n\nTL;DR rescued a kitten, brought her home, don't know what to do now",

He went about a day without eating and I put some wet food out and he took to it immediately. This made me think that it was the food not his appetite. I spoke with a pet nutritionist and she suggested Solid Gold and Soulistic. I figured I would give it a whirl and he took to both immediately.\nWe have already purchased a few toys, a bed, litter box and clumping litter, a filtering water bottle, food dish w/ removable tray that is washable, a scratching post, tons of food and a collar.\n\nIs there anything that is necessary or even simply useful to have that I don't have already?

    "title": "New cat owner needs some flair:'advice'",
    "description": "I recently adopted a kitten (4 months old when I got her, she's 6 months now) and need some general advice.\n\nFirst off, she developed (or came to me with?) giardia a week or two after getting her. That was treated over the course of 8 days and cleared up. But, it's back! She also tested positive for roundworms after those 8 days, but a recent test was negative (she did get a treatment for the roundworms, and has a follow up next week). The giardia is bad enough that she sometimes gets poop on her hind legs or hind paws and tracks it all over the house. If I'm home and I see it when she goes, I approach her and she lets me clean her with baby wipes. If I'm not home, it's problematic... she's banned from the bedroom since the first time I saw this she had gotten poo on the bed. :/\n\nI live in an apartment and she is kept indoors (although she's managed to jump out on the front porch a few times now). I keep her out of the bathroom, but sometimes she runs in there, sniffs around, and I get her out. She has clean food and water, and I clean the litter box 1 - 2 times a day.\n\nShe uses a water dish that has an inverted bottle which I can refill once a week so that she has plenty of water all the time.\n\nShe doesn't get up on the kitchen counter/sink at all.\n\nShe has been eating (or just chewing/clawing) paper. Receipts, bills, homework, etc. She gets up on my laptop, which I've tried to deter her from, but she still gets up here and will drag things off my desk (knick-knacks, action figures (she chewed up the lightsaber of a Luke Skywalker :/ Maybe she's part Wampa...)\n\nSo some questions:\n1) How can I nail down how she's getting the giardia? There's no standing water that she has access too aside from her water dish. The vet asked me a series of questions about the environment, and nothing was conclusive. I'm suspicious of the water dish, or the few times that she's gone in the bathroom (but always in view of me and I get her out of there quickly). Should I change to a fountain type watering solution?\n\n2) How can I keep her from eating my action figures, knick-knacks, and papers? I'm a human, I have human needs too... like some light clutter on my desk. She has 2 scratching posts and some toys.\n\n3) Although I clean the litter box 1 - 2 times a day, I change the whole thing about one to two weeks. I wipe down the entire litter box with Clorox wipes, allow to dry, then refill. I'm using Swheat Scoop llitter which I like so far because it clumps really well. It seems a little dusty, so I'm considering switching to a corn based litter. Is my schedule for cleaning the litter box good enough? Should I be replacing all the litter each week? At about $13/bag it's a bit spendy... though I could get cheaper litter (clay based), but I never liked that kind when I've been around cats before.\n\n4) A stray cat in my complex sprayed the outside of my front door. My cat gets a little spooked when she goes near the front door now, but not enough that she doesn't jump out sometimes. She doesn't run away, she just wants to go outside and lets me pick her up. How can I deter her from going outside?\n\n5) She seems to \"play\" rough with me. Sometimes pounces on my feet and claws/bites them, or my other body parts. Lately she's taken a liking to jump up on the back of my legs when I'm at the kitchen sink. Will she grow out of this? It turns, but she doesn't seem to be mean about it. She seems to be playing, but I do have scratch marks.\n\nPlease ask me any question about my situation.\n\ntl;dr New cat owner, but clueless, needs advice/help please!\n\nPicture of my cat.

This holiday season I'll be flying back home to visit family, and I'm taking her with me. Originally I wanted yo leave her at home where she's comfortable and have someone watch her, but I've had no luck with that. I don't know anyone well enough yet to trust her to, and I don't want to gave her boarded simple because her being in a cage for 23 hrs out of the day, I just couldn't do it. \n\nSo lacking any other option, she's flying with the girlfriend and I on the plane. She's a tiny kitty and will be in the cabin with us. I've already booked the reservation for her as well. I would very much appreciate and ideas, suggestions, or comments from personal experience you all have with this topic. I've flown before with no problems, but never with a pet. I want to make sure she's as comfortable and stress free as possible, as she's about the most important thing to me. I'll be flying Southwest airlines if that matters.",

I want to bring him inside and adopt him but he is wary of humans. It gets cold here and I am worried he won't survive the winter. He seems very docile, will run away when approached. I've left food for him, but he took it when it was on the sidewalk but wouldn't approach my door. How can I gain his trust and get him to come in before the snow comes? ",

    "description": "My cats react well to catnip so I did  some looking up. You can buy live Nepeta cataria (true catnip) plants and plant them in your garden. They last multiple years and reproduce really well. If your cat likes catnip, it will hang around the plants, sniffing them, batting at them and sometimes even lying down on them.\n\nNepeta cataria isn't just for cats either. The plant contains chemicals that repel mosquitoes, attract insects that eat destructive aphids and leaf-eaters and you can use catnip in your tea as it is a member of the mint family. It also seems to have a few medicinal properties. ( digestive aid, sleep aid,  calming effect, good for colds and the flu)\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catnip#Cultivation\n\n\nhttp://nepetacataria.org/\n\n\nhttp://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Nepeta+cataria\n\nI think it's a good idea. My family agrees. We'll be looking to plant some in Spring.\n\n[Also have a video of  a cat enjoying catnip!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-I_knYz9j0)\n",

    "description": "Hello, I have an issue. My tom is neutered, about 6-7 years old. He was diagnosed with FLUTD because he was had urinary blockages quite a few times, probably 10 times. It never required surgery, he unblocked after a few days because he was never fully blocked, it would just become very inflamed, he would drip blood and urine, etc. He's had catheters put in for it at times as well when it was really bad. He did the Urinary diet by Medical for awhile, but it didn't really help. We put him on a raw diet and now he doesn't block anymore, every so often he'll get a flare-up though with blood and-or infection. But the real issue now is that he constantly drips pee, like always. There's always pee drips all over the floor and on the couches now, but he seems happy and healthy otherwise! My vet recommended a Perineal Urethrostomy, I think is what they're called. He wants to remove his penis because he believes that is what is causing the issue, he tested it by trying to put a catheter in him a few weeks ago and it wouldn't go in, so he said his penis was damaged because of so much inflammation over the past few years.\n\n\nHas anyone here experienced this/these issues? Have you had this surgery for your kitties? I know nothing about it really or the risks, I love my baby so much! I don't want him to be in pain and I don't want him to suffer anymore, any help is appreciated.",

    "title": "Advice for dealing with fleas?",
    "description": "Hello,\n\nI bought a cat from petco ~4 months ago. She was in good health, no scratching herself or anything. Total sweetheart, I love her to bits. She stays in my room 99% of the time, and I never let her outside. \n\n\nAround the same time, a stray cat (had no collar, and was not neutered) began to constantly wait outside our back door. (We recently moved into the house, the previous owners may have fed him?) The stray would try to get into the house if we opened the door, he would sleep on our chairs, approach us if we were outside, etc. \n\n\nMy brother began feeding the stray, and since winter was approaching, my dad decided to get the stray neutered and put him in the garage when it's cold at night or raining. My brother began to let the stray inside the house and let him run around. A few times my cat was loose in the house at the same time the stray cat was. \n\n\nMy cat did not like the stray at all. She would hiss anytime she saw him, and while I don't think they ever actually fought, it was close. (The stray never actually went near my cat if he could help it.) \n\n\nI don't know if the stray had fleas, he didn't seem to scratch himself a lot and my brother swears he doesn't have any, but I'm betting that that's where they came from since, from my understanding, cats don't just randomly be fine one day and get fleas the next without ever having been exposed to the outdoors or other animals. \n\n\nA week ago, I noticed a bug on my cat's head. Upon further inspection, I realized she had fleas. The next day I gave her a bath, vacuumed my rooms, and washed all my bedding. It didn't help much, and she's still scratching. I have since given her a few more baths, and vacuumed again, and I ordered flea shampoo for her. I have put her in the bathroom with her litterbox and food stuff. What else can I do? \n\n\n*TL;DR*: My cat has fleas (Possibly from a stray cat). How can I get rid of them? Will keeping my cat in the bathroom limit the fleas? \n",

We had both cats on dry food but the vet said the male needs to be on wet food for urinary issues, but the younger female cat can eat the special wet food too. The problem is that the male cat loves the wet food, but the younger female won't touch it. I can't leave the dry food out for her because the male will start to eat it again. I tried two different flavors for the royal Canin cat food but the female won't eat it at all, even after that was the only food left out for 24 hours she left it and cried and cried until I gave her dry food. \n\nSo I'm just wondering what my options might be? I saw they make dry food royal canin but the vet said really the wet version would be best. I thought that eventually the female would just eat it if there was nothing else but that hasn't seemed to work. Any advice on how to get the female to eat the wet food would be great. ",

    "description": "As the title dictates, sometimes my new kitten will refrain from doing primarily number two's in her litter box. She has this weird thing where she goes to the toilet behind our bar. I don't really know what sparked it, I looked up a few things, and one of the suggestions was a dirty litter box and her litter box not being in a convenient spot, and her litter box is in a cage with her food and water, and her litter box was pretty clean, but I changed it anyway to be safe. I think as it goes for those two things, its pretty good, because sometimes during the day, she'll come into my room and take a dump, but other times, she won't.\n\nThe only thing I can spark reason as to why she is doing this, is because one night she accidentally got locked out my room. To also mention, I have never owned a cat in my life, and I had no advice about owning a cat going into this, its really just a learning experience for me, I've always owned dogs. Also to mention, I didn't lock her out of my room on purpose, she has a few hiding spots which are kind of hard for me to fully locate her because of cabinets or mass loads of other objects in the way, so I just figured she was in my room. She must have got desperate at some point in the night and gone toilet behind the bar.\n\nIs there anything I can do to try and stop this, because the smell wafts into the living room and its not very nice. If it requires me to completely barricade that section off, I will do it, but if there are other steps I can take, or any advice people could give me, that would be amazing.",

    "description": "First off, let me prefix this with - I love these fluffy little shits to death, they are just wonderful companions. But they are the naughtiest cats I've ever met. \n\nI've got a pair of male neutered cats that are 1.5 years old. They were hand raised and act more like dogs than cats... until it comes to discipline. They have a cat flap to go outside if they want but they're indoors 80% of the time (their decision). \n\nThey are constantly taking food off the worktop, trying to get into the fridge, stealing their wet food packets (I was half an hour late to work a few weeks ago because one of them snuck into the larder behind me and stole a packet of food - and growled at me as I chased him around the kitchen to get it back). One of them has eaten peanut butter chocolate, cookies, bread, anything. If you leave *anything* on the counter top they're going to get it and they are not deterred by packets, boxes, storage jars. They knock shit off the worktop to open it. They've broken into and eaten so much stuff. We can't shut them out of the kitchen because that's where their cat flap is as well as their food/water bowls. We simply don't have enough storage to put everything away all the time.\n\nWe had a package delivered the other day. Within in ten minutes, one of them had chewed through it (silk scarf) and ripped holes in it. They eat our mail. We've had to replace our oven gloves about five times now because one of them really enjoys eating them and renders them useless. They've chomped on our christmas tree and eat flowers/cards/picture frames/whatever is in reach.\n\nThey fight each other a lot - all really fluff and noise but when they're chasing each other they have no awareness of anything and knock anything in their way over. I've been scalded in the past because they've run into my arm as I was about to drink from my coffee mug. Yet they sleep next to each other occasionally and groom each other. \n\nThey pee everywhere. I've lost two pairs of shoes now because they won't stop peeing in them. That means as well that we can't trust them in bedrooms where they can hide under the bed and pee in hidden spots!\n\nThey're not mean - they don't swipe, and whilst they're quite vocal in growling nothing comes off of it. I really don't want to keep disciplining them because I feel like we do then they will turn nasty. They are honestly the funniest cats I've ever had; one chases shadows, the other chases hair ties and huffs until you throw them properly for him. And they love a good snuggle. But it feels a bit like we're living with a pair of naughty toddlers most of the time!",

Took her to the vet recently and she has bladder stones. The best treatment is surgery which is around $1000\n\nGiven the cost of the surgery and her age in wondering if it is worth it to go through. How will her recovery be with her age? Has anyone been in similar circumstances? My opinion is not to do it but the rest of my family thinks we should.",

Not the usual little fights.  Like really going after her.  I put hernia one of our bedrooms with the door shut for an hour or two to calm her down.  \n\nMy other cat is now very scared and acting anxious.  I have brought the cat that is acting aggressive.  She stills seems interested in going after my other cat who is now hissing and meowing at her if she is in the same room as her.  Have any of you had any problems with your cats like this?

    "description": "I am owned by a petite 14 year old kitty with a sensitive stomach. I moved in to her apartment years ago and she quickly made me her human. She has always had a very sensitive stomach, which I think developed from only eating cheap dry food, and occasionally swallowing it whole. I've tried wet food in the past, but it turns her litter box into a crime scene. Since there is a dog in our new home, I keep her litter box in my room, and this leads to me waking up gagging at 4 AM. I had some recent success with Science Diet Mature Chunks in Gravy, until she didn't eat for a whole day and we ended up in the animal hospital. I've since given up on my own sleep and have been feeding her Science Diet Mature Minced Turkey. She loves it. I spent days transitioning from multiple small servings, back to her old schedule of morning, dinner, and before bed. The problems are  the litter box is worse than ever, with horrific smelling, dark poops AND it seems the food is not very filling. She frequently complains and begs for more food. And yes it is for food, because if I take a step towards her, she runs to her dish. \n\nDoes anyone have a good feeding guide for mature cats? Recommendations for food that doesn't smell like a skunk that died from eating vomit before I even feed it to her, and worse when it wakes me up in the stinky dead of night? \n\nIf you are going to post, \"Take her to the vet\" please save both our times. Because, A) Duuuurrrrrr.  B) I'm currently feeding her _more_ than the vet suggested. C) I will be taking her back to the vet soon to for shots/checkup. I simply want a good nights sleep.\n\nThanks to anyone in advance for suggestions/info/etc. I do love her to pieces. There's nothing like waking up with a warm kitty stocking cap in the winter, or having her curl up under my arm while I scratch her neck for an hour. I want her to be happy, and I want these next few years to be as comfortable as possible for her. She is basically 80.",

    "description": "I'm not sure where to post this question. Either here or AskReddit,  but decided to try here, first. \n\nMy three year old male cat likes to make a complete mess of whatever water options I give him. He used to have his own bowl that was a half gallon but he would splash the water all over the place to the point where I had to use a tarp and a towel on the carpet to soak up spills. \n\nLately, he hasn't been drinking out of the bowl in the spare room (I don't keep the water next to the food at all) and so I let him share the two gallon refill water dispenser with the dog. I've noticed he always goes to stick his head to the very back of the water bowl after swishing water out of the bowl. Essentially, he helps to mop my kitchen. I've heard that bubblers/fountains work for this. If I get a fountain, will this curtail his need to soak the surrounding area with water? I know they don't like stagnant water but this is only my second cat and the only one to make such a mess. \n\nAny ideas for the best one to get? Thank you so much for anyone to who replies. ",

They were going to be safe in my house, fed and let out for a while a day, but over the last week, the man has become severely ill in hospital and this morning was diagnosed with stomach, lung and kidney cancer (probably with not long left to live) so the chances are now they won't be able to care for my kitties. They were also the only friends my family have who are both cat friendly/experienced and have the time as well as being very trust worthy.\n\nThe only other option left if my cats going into a cattery and (understandably) I'm worried. It seems like a nice, professional care home but I'm worried my cats will be emotionally affected, maybe with no attention when they are used to cuddles and love all day long.\n\nWere your cats fine after leaving a cattery? Or is it a bad idea?",

    "title": "Looking for some Advice About My Cats Fighting",
    "description": "I have had a male (neutered) Himalayan cat for the past 6 years. I rescued him after he turned up lost in my backyard and he is the greatest pet. He has a very sweet and affectionate disposition and just wants to cuddle all the time.\n\nLast year another cat turned up in my backyard. It is an orange, short haired female. I will call her Orange Cat. I fed her all through last winter but she was really wild and would not let me get close to her.\n\nHowever over this past summer she got friendlier with me. I would take my Himalayan into the backyard and they started playing together. They would explore in the garden while I watched and eventually she let me pet her and would eat in front of me.\n\nAs Fall came the Orange Cat started wanting to come into the house and would literally run through my legs as I opened the door. I didnt want another pet so I built her a shelter in the backyard which she used, but started coming into the house more and more as winter set in.\n\nAs winter came, we felt sorry for her and so when it was really cold I would let her stay in the house. She is not a bad pet. Despite some wild tendencies Orange Cat knows how to use the litter and is reasonably affectionate, though still pretty standoffish and won't let us pick her up.\n\nThe problem is how she gets along with my Himalayan. They seem to have a love hate relationship. Sometimes they will go through the house exploring every nook and cranny together and sleep on the couch together.\n\nOther times, the Orange Cat beats the crap out of my Himalayan. She is much heavier and bigger than him; the Himalayan must have been the runt of the litter.\n\nJust this morning I heard a commotion in the other room and found the Orange Cat on top of my Himalayan. She had him flipped on his back and was straddling him, holding him down and seemed to be trying to bit him.\n\nWhen I intervened the Himalayan got lose and the Orange Cat chased him into the other room, landing some whacks on his behind and trying to grab him. I don't know if she had her claws out.\n\nI grabbed the Orange Cat and put her outside. This has happened before, and so I am afraid to leave them alone.\n\nI can't really tell if they are play fighting or not. Sometimes I have seen the Himalayan instigate the fights. He will grab Orange Cat's tail or bite it repeatedly until she retaliates by whacking him with a paw across the face and then he comes running to me,\n\nI am considering keeping the Orange Cat but not if it means subjecting my little furry bundle of Himalayan joy to abuse and bullying by the Orange Cat.  i should also mention that the Orange Cat has claws like a wolverine and she has scratched me a couple of times causing deep cuts each time. But I havent seen any damage on my Himalayan, so I don't know if she is trying to hurt him or not.\n\nMy Himalayan seems stressed and now spends a lot of time in the bedroom, which is the one room where we keep the door closed so the Orange Cat cannot go in.\n\nAny suggestions what I could do to put a stop to this?",

    "title": "My kitty is sick. :(",
    "description": "Hi, new cat owner here. I have recently gotten my first cat 11 days ago, he's a big kitty that weighted at 17 lb a month ago. He's a DLH but I suspect he's a Nibelung. His history is unknown but he was found on the streets and was staying at the Durham shelter and was on deathrow up until a month ago. when my local agency picked him up, nursed him and a month later I adopted him.\n\nWhen I adopted him, they had told me he has a clean bill of health, declawed previously, all his vaccines, and eats/plays regularly; however the situation worsened since I've adopted him. When I first got the cat I gave him a box to hide in which he loved, he didn't eat much that day to which I thought was normal.  Then it continued for another 4 days or so, by then he has probably only eaten a cup of dry food, and half a can of wet food in total, and only 2 pieces of poop. He has been peeing regularly 1 clump a day . He would walk over and sniff the food, have a few bites and walk away, he would maybe eat 3 pebbles if I hand fed him. This was alarming because at that point I know he's already familiar with the new house as he has started sleeping everywhere, and would jump onto the sofa and knead when I'm around. I continued monitoring him and bought a variety of foods for him to eat (authority brand wet and dry) as that what he was eating for the past 4 weeks). He showed interest at human tuna as I had it one day, to which I fed him about a quarter can of as I thought some food is better than none. Then at day 8 things got bad, he would turn his head away when I try to feed him, and refused any kind of food. His water intake lessened. On day 9 I returned to the agency, they said try to feed him some junk food to get him to eat first. He had a sniff at the friskies and went ham. Finished a quarter can in record time. Only to puke it out 5 hours later. I fed him some water and he voluntarily went back to friskies again. To which he puked again... About 5 hours later. At this point I was really worried and made arrangements with a vet as he was flat on the ground and was moaning. On day 10, I tried offering him another wet food, he sniffed it once and started puking immediately. When we were at the vets they did the routine check and found that kitty was dehydrated, and determined something is off, but not sure what until more diagnosis. Vet tried to feed him A/D 3 times but he puked all 3 times just smelling the food. Vet recommended sub q and said he was very nauseated, gave him some dizzy meds and antacid. He was then a happy, but tired kitty. Same day I began force feeding him. Mushing up A/D and made him ate a quarter of a can. Then we are at today. He looks more vibrant, but still tired. I will continue feeding him every 3 hours until he starts eating food on his own. My theory is that he's been stressed out for so long that he hasn't been eating proper, and when he finally did start eating his intestines couldn't handle it. To which he has associated food with throwing up and grew weary of it. Nausea might be a combination of dehydration and car rides. He also hasn't touched any chemicals or plants AFAIK. Ideas?",

    "description": "So I've heard a lot of things about kitty collars- both good and bad. Basically I'm trying to decide whether I want to put collars on my two cats. They are both indoor cats, but sometimes they try to dart out the door when I open it. They are too young yet to be microchipped; the vet here won't do it until they are old enough to be spayed/neutered. I would be super devastated if I lost one of my cats.\n\nMy biggest fear about putting a collar on them is that they'll accidentally hang themselves with it and I won't be there to save them. My kitties are pretty young yet, so they are very rambunctious and they climb all over everything and jump, etc. So I suppose there's some risk there. I did buy each of them breakaway collars and they are wearing them right now, I'm just nervous about leaving them alone with the collars on. \n\nSo does anyone here have experience with putting collars on their indoor cat??

We tried contacting the no kill shelters if they could take them in but none of the shelters have been returning our calls and it's been two weeks!\n\nPlease, if any of you are interested in helping out and adopting these two babies please please help.

Our vet believes he has FIP, but of course there's no way to test definitively. We have him on a low dose of prednisolone to keep him comfy. After about a week of steroids, our vet came back and said there is a small chance he has haemobartonellosis instead, which is NOT fatal if treated, so we started him on antibiotics. The day we began antibiotics, he instantly perked up. He has been hyper and chipper and putting on weight. I don't know if I'm allowed to get my hopes up over this, though. So my question -- people who have seen cats lose a battle with FIP, were there points during steroid treatment that they seemed perfectly healthy? More hyper than before, and a better appetite? \n\nI dont want to lose him =(",

When we got him, he was anxious/depressed at the shelter and would lay in the litter box. He stopped that after we (me and my boyfriend) adopted him. He seemed normal. 6 weeks later we adopted a senior cat (14), Mickey, that my boyfriend fell in love with  when we picked up Jake from the shelter. At first Jake didn't like mickey, but now they are fine. They never fought or anything, but Jake kept his distance. Now they have no problems being close. They are inside cats and only on a few occasions has either of them shown any interest in outside besides going out on the balcony (which if either of us are home, we keep that door open for them). Both are friendly and loving. Tonight, though, we went out to run errands and when we returned, Jake was laying in the litter box. I had to pick him up and he is now sitting in my lap as I write this. He seems healthy; going to the bathroom normally and everything looks good as far as I know. I try to interact with him as much as possible and I anyways thought he was happy. Does anyone have any resources or advice for me? We're boarding both of them over new years so I was planning on having the vet look at him then. Should I take him in sooner? If anything changes I will for sure, but if things stay as they are I was going to wait. Can cats get bored or lack stimulation? How much should I interact with him? Could this be depression?

    "description": "Good day everyone, this is my first and possibly only post here as i'm not a huge fan of cats, i'm more a dog type, but i have a cat that we took from the streets back in 2002.    \nI'll try to keep it short, but i also want to give as much context as possible.    \nShe was found when she was around 2yo(we can't be certain because we didn't raised her) and from that day on she stayed with us. For ten years she was free to enter and exit from our house into a neighborhood where she was able to roam freely, hunting and exploring even the gardens around. Three years ago we had to move to an apartment where she's no longer free of going outside because there isn't a garden(there's a balcony, but she won't go there after a stray climbed there and fought against her) and we even changed job, leaving her alone at home for almost all the day.    \nFrom a couple of months she started acting strange, she seems tired never leaving the sofa if not for eating, drinking and going to the litter. When we come home from work she starts meowing constantly and apparently for no reason as there's food, there's water and the litter it's clean.    \nMy question then are, it's my cat depressed? Or is it possible that she simply lacks company or entertainment? She's simply getting old(14/15 yo)? Is it also possible that she caught a parasite that's tiring her?    \nIt breaks my heart seeing her like this because she was always extremely lively in the other home, constantly hunting birds and lizards, climbing trees and beating down the other cats without even taking a scratch. She was the cat queen of the neighborhood and if i can do something to make her a bit happier i would like to know if some of you have suggestions.    \nThanks in advance.",

    "description": "I recently moved into a house for the purpose of taking care of a cat (long story short, grandfather died, it was his cat, I work nearby, family figured stress of relocating would kill the cat, so they relocated me instead), and we've been getting along pretty well so far. I'd met the cat several times before this. He's probably about 14 or 15 years old and he doesn't like people very much. When the mailman or a tradesman comes, he runs and hides in my bedroom. I've lived with cats all my life, but for the most part this has been my stepmom's cats that I don't have to actually care for or spend a lot of time with. \n\nMy main question is, can cats actually love people? Do they understand what we're saying? I asked about this on ELI5 a few months ago and the general consensus was that if the cat isn't hissing at you or scratching, he doesn't mind what you're doing and might even like it. He occasionally runs around the house, but doesn't \"play\" as much as he used to, I assume because he's older. He sleeps more that most cats I know. I talk to him all the time, and I'm never sure how much of it he understands. \n\nBasically, our day starts with me getting coffee and sitting with him while he eats (he likes it when people watch him eat, ELI5 said this had something to do with predators and being on the lookout), I clean out his litterbox after he's done eating. He naps for a while, then I go to work. When I come home I feed him again (he's really thin so I figure it can't hurt to feed him 2-3 times a day) and we sit together in the recliner and watch Law and Order reruns until it's time for bed. Sometimes he sits on the couch behind my head, sometimes on my chest, and he doesn't seem to mind when I hug him. \n\nI just don't want to accidentally break any cat laws due to accidentally becoming too comfortable with him and treating him like a person. I've been reading articles about how some dogs are confused by primate behavior like hugging or head kissing (which could be perceived as hostile to the dogs), and I don't want to do something weird to the cat that he might not understand.

It never bothered me before, but now we have a 1-year old human and it's extremely disruptive.\n\nShe literally only meows when someone in the house is asleep, usually just outside the door of their bedroom or in the hall. When you approach her, she runs away to the opposite side of the house. She'll respond to play or food, but neither will quiet her. There is no specific location of the sleeper or time of day that triggers it (we have chaotic sleeping schedules). When the baby is asleep in someones arms on the sofa, she will crawl up on the back of the sofa to meow directly in your ear.\n\nThis is not new behavior. This happens everywhere we've  lived. I've consulted the vet, given her extra play time and different food and calming sprays and catnip furniture and positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement and ignoring it conpletely.\n\nIn all other respects she's a totally normal cat. It's as if she doesn't understand why humans need sleep, and that confusion angers her. \n\nAny thoughts? \n\nEdit: reposted because i added flair wrong :p",

    "description": "About a month ago we got a new kitten, which I named Mara. Our older cat (she's around 6 years old) wasn't pleased with it. She kept hissing and growling at her and hitting her with her paw (both are female). The kitten was of course scared, so she kept hiding under our neughbor's porch.\n\nLast week one of the cats pooped near the older one's food bowl. Ok, accidents happen. Or so I thought. Yesteday it happened again, and she pooped in 3 piles.. so the poop was distributed around both bowls (for food and water).\n\nThis happened around half an hour ago: I went out on the porch and started stroking both of them. The older one jumped on my lap and I put the smaller one up on my lap aswell (they surprisingly didn't hiss or growl at each other). I was really happy to see that they are starting to tolerate each other (more like the older one is starting to tolerate the kitten). This went on for about 20 minutes until Mara (kitten) started playing with my hoodie and scratched my hand in the process. So I put her down. Then I looked to my left (where the older cat's food bowl is) too see that one of them pooped in the exact same spot once again.\nI suspect the kitten because, well, she's only 4 months old and doesn't know any better(?). Her cat toilet is 2 meters away, by the way. And she's used it before.\n\nPhotos;\n\nThis is the only photo I have of both of them;\n\n http://imgur.com/OL7qWkc\n\nI just took this one 15 minutes ago (warning: poop!);\n\n http://imgur.com/RNZTtE7\n\nAlso (before anyone asks), they are both outdoor cats. We don't live near any busy roads, so they're pretty safe here.\n\nEDIT: spelling",

    "title": "Cat refuses to use litter box - In need of serious advice",
    "description": "Hello all,\n\nI apologize for the long post, but we are in dire need of help with this cat. His name is Axel. We are 5 weeks away from the due date for our first child, and we love our cat but his urine problems have us at a point where we may not be able to have him stay here, especially with a new baby in our lives.\n\nBonus pictures: [Kitten Axel](http://imgur.com/4t5BC5U) and [Grown-up Axel](http://imgur.com/NYpyHPS)\n\nLet me start off with a bit of a back story. We have two male cats, adopted on the same day but not blood related. We adopted them at 8 weeks old and they are now a little over 18 months old. Both cats are neutered.\n\nA few months after adopting them, we discovered multiple pee spots on our basement carpet. We quickly realized which cat they were from. It was Axel.\n\nAfter a trip to the vet, this was deemed a behavioral issue that would hopefully be helped once they are neutered. However, weeks after they had been neutered, the issue continued. We did our research and got an understanding of what cats like and dislike in for their litter boxes. We got an additional box (totaling 3 for 2 cats) and placed it on the upper level of the house. We switched to [Cat Attract](http://preciouscat.com/product/cat-attract/) litter. When we first poured the new litter into the box, we were amazed that Axel immediately went in the litter box and had a pee before we even finished pouring the litter. Awesome! Problem solved, right?\n\nNope. About 6 months later, urine spots around the house started appearing again. Another trip to the vet and he is diagnosed with Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease [FLUTD](http://icatcare.org/advice/feline-lower-urinary-tract-disease-flutd). We were sent home with an anti-inflammatory drug for Axel. However, the situation has not stabilized.\n\nRecently (2 weeks ago), he was urinating outside of his box and it was followed by hissing and growling. Obvious pain. Another trip to the vet and it was determined that he was blocked and could not pee. The vet kept him over night with a catheter and fluids to clear him out, and released him to us. Later in the same day that we brought him home, he began squatting to pee constantly (every few steps) and small bloody spots would appear, as well as sometimes nothing coming out and leaving him in obvious pain. \n\nThe next morning, we were forced to take him back to the vet. They inserted a catheter and kept him with fluids again, this time for about 30 hours. He was not blocked this time. We were sent home with an anti-inflammatory drug along with a drug to help calm his sphincter from spasming, which the vet says was likely causing him to squat constantly.\n\nAfter taking him home, he has some slight improvement. Not urinating as much as before, but still bloody and still not in the litter box. The vet came up with a different plan for medication. A stronger anti-inflammatory drug and an anti-depressant, as stress can be a strong factor in cats refusing to use the litter box.\n\nThat brings us to today. In terms of health, he is great. No blood in his urine, not urinating too frequently, no signs of pain. He is happy, playing with us, etc. However, he still refuses to use his litter. For context, out of approximately 50 urinations over the last 2 weeks, only **TWO** have been in the litter box. I should also mention that while he does have certain spots that he prefers to urinate, he will go anywhere. We make sure to thoroughly clean any area that he has gone. Tile floor, carpet, our bed, whatever. Doesn't matter to him. As long as it isn't the litter box. \n\nThis is obviously very hard on us. My girlfriend is 35 weeks pregnant, the cost of the vet bills was way out of our budget, the cost of cleaning materials to constantly clean up his urine is painful, the stress of worrying about him peeing on the carpet any time we don't see him is hard on us. The list goes on.\n\nHere is what we have tried in the last 2 weeks with no improvement:\n\n* Cleaning litter boxes (3)\n* Replacing all litter with fresh Cat Attract litter\n* Purchasing 3 brand new litter boxes to replace the existing ones\n* Different products to clean urine spots\n* Closing off as many rooms in the house as possible\n* A recycled paper style of litter in one of the old litter boxes\n* At least one litter box on each level of the house\n\nThe food the cats are being fed:\n\n* [C/D Wet Food](http://www.hillspet.com/products/pd-feline-cd-multicare-seafood-canned.html) (Urinary formula)\n* [C/D Stress Formula Dry Food](http://www.hillspet.com/products/pd-feline-cd-multicare-stress-with-chicken-dry.html)\n\nI believe that covers it.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. We love Axel and we want him to be with us for many years to come.\n\n\nedit: Added diet information",

    "description": "I have 2 cats, Faso and Brrr. We used to have a third, but we rehomed her to a friend because Faso wouldn't stop attacking her. She would scream and carry on and wasn't happy. A friend who adored her offered to take her so he wasn't upsetting her all the time. \n\nWe got Nano first. She was all black and we got her from a shelter. She was the sweetest cat ever :) then we got Brrr, a snow Bengal, as a friend for Nano because we didn't want her to be lonely. They got along so well, but I had gone temporarily insane and decided to breed Brrr since she had never been fixed. We got the third cat, Faso, a male Bengal, about 6 months later. \n \nWe moved around a lot, and were living primarily out of one room for around 6 months before getting our own apartment. That's when Faso started attacking Nano constantly. Within 1.5 years we rehomed her. We moved into a house with a friend, but she had cats and we had to keep them confined again to one room or Faso would fight with them (usually making them pee on him). \n\nBut now, we've bought a new house. It has 3 floors, one for each animal apparently. We have a chihuahua who is afraid of the basement and isn't allowed upstairs. He attacks Brrr every time she touches the floor. Faso has claimed the basement for himself, which used to have both litter boxes. Brrr hides upstairs when we aren't around to stop the dog and Faso from attacking her. Recently we noticed anything left upstairs on the floor was used immediately as a litter box. We determined that the boys were keeping Brrr from her litter box and moved one upstairs. But since then, Faso has been attacking more ferociously. In the 6 years we've had the cats, we've never had an attack so bad that Brrr has peed during it. She is my baby and admittedly my favorite. My husband wants to rehome Faso, and whereas I hate to admit it, we can't have him constantly attacking Brrr. She is scared all the time. And he has been a problem in the past. I know he is being alpha or whatever, but he is making her life hell attacking her all the time. He's the sweetest cat and loves dogs, but he can't be around other cats without attacking them.

None of us were really prepared, but we love cats so we were excited.\n\n\nMy sister has mental problems. Personality and emotional. Tonight, she screamed her head off right by the cat's \"safe room\" where we have it getting acclimated to the new smells and sounds of a new home. Sister then stormed out for two hours, and I sat with new cat, helping her relax. She was clearly shaken up, constantly sitting up and trying to look out the door of her \"room\".\n\n\nSister is back home. Again, right next to the \"safe room\", which this cat cannot escape from (it's her second night here, first full day, and we have 3 other cats). Obviously, this cat is even more scared, and this will be a huge setback in getting her feeling safe and happy here. I feel like shit, because why take in an animal when you can't manage your kid, this poor, poor cat.\n\n\nSo here I am, wondering what I can do to de-stress a cat. I've heard about scented things and classical music, but I'm tempted to think that's all BS, so hopefully someone has personal experience or other advice here?

The only time she ate in the last week was when I dropped a piece of rotisserie chicken and she pounced. She'll ignore her food and water dish, more so when Puddles is around. \nI'll be taking her to the vet to see what they tell us is wrong. I just wanted to see if others have had this issue. Thanks!

    "description": "I'm allergic to some cats, but not all cats.  Some instantly make my eyes water and throat itch, while others have no effect on me at all.  My wife and son have been wanting a cat for years but I've been afraid to roll the dice and risk the huge downside of living with a pet I'm allergic to.\n\nSo I'm wondering... if I go to our local shelter and find a kitten that I don't react to, can I safely assume that's how it'll be going forward?  Or do things w/r/t allergies often change over time?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.",

    "title": "I am transitioning cats to wet food and scheduled meals; I have some questions.",
    "description": "Hello everyone!\n\nAs stated above, I am transitioning my cats to wet food and scheduled meals. I never thought that getting a cat to decide between eating food vs starving would be this frustrating. However, I was successful in getting them to eat wet food.\n\nNow for the situation: My cats are different sizes and thus need different amounts of food. When given the food together, they try and eat from each other's bowls or not at all (One cat doesn't like the other) This means I have to separate them for meals. When left alone, they will not eat. I have to be in the room and repeatedly pick them up and put them in front of the food multiple times (Seriously, up to 37 times. Yes. I've started counting). I also find that they stare at the door and/or run to the door and prefer to try to get out than eat. (e.g., They will scratch at the door as if the house is on fire the entire time.) Again, if I am not there; no food is eaten. \n\nFor those wondering: They have to be locked up for the meal feedings because in the 10-30 minutes of the food being out, they acknowledge that it is there and then decide to attempt at escaping. This is not conducive to scheduling their meals at all.\n\nI have read that they would just \"learn that they better eat when they can!\" No. Not even close. I tried that for one day and they chose to not eat and then threw up bile and water. I became worried that they'd develop hepatic lipidosis and this is why I have to lock them up and sit/stand with them and coax them to eat. When I am in the room, and again with 20 minutes of constant coaxing they will gladly start devouring the meal. I then tried leaving them alone AGAIN; they chose no food and again, threw up bile. I know that they enjoy the food because they will DEVOUR it when they feel ready to eat.\n\nThe whole reason I had to switch to wet food is they were vomiting once every week / couple weeks each on various dry foods we'd been trying. Also, one cat (the cunt) has been licking herself on the back legs and inner thigh to the point that she is hairless there. I suspect a grain allergy. The transition to wet food is a part of testing my hypothesis.\n\nI fucking love my cats. They're my god damn children at this point. Since I have transitioned them to wet food: they have lost weight, been incredibly active, cuddly, playful during the day, and all around better. I want what's best.\n\nI am starting school in less than a month and I need to get them on scheduled feeding. When I start, I will not have time to spend 1 hour each meal. I know that patience is key but this has been going on for months. I'm running out of time. Any advice, tips, ... fuck. Anything at this point would be appreciated. I just want what's best for these little shitheads.\n\n**TL;DR: cats choose starvation over food; owner not pleased**",

He took it well, and we had no problems. This time around, he is much less cooperative. He only has 3 days of pills left, but I simply can't get him to take them. He always spits them back up, no matter how far down his throat I try to get them. He fights back a little, and finally hissed at me for the first time today.\n\nI have tried pill pockets (no dice), and mixing it with his wet food (also no dice). I've tried getting him right after a nap so he's more docile (No dice), and bribing him before and after. He's now learned that treats = pills and won't take treats or eat his wet food.\n\nAny suggestions? I will probably request the liquid form next time, but I'd really like him to finish this course of antibiotics so we can avoid another trip to the vet...\n\nThanks in advance.",

They are also half Siamese, which we've heard are happier when paired with other Siamese.\n\nHowever, they play fight a lot and sometimes one meows out of pain (we assume). For now they are both not neutered and though we weren't exactly against the idea, we weren't decided on it either.\n\nWill neutering both, or just one, help reduce their tendency to fight more aggressively? Or even if the meows happen while fighting, we shouldn't worry about it unless one becomes visibly injured (bloody scratches or bite marks).",

    "description": "Over the Summer my parents purchased a brand new couch. This wouldn't be an issue if my cat didn't decide to start messing with it. The problem is the corner is beginning to already show signs of fraying and if I can't find a viable solution in 5 days from today I will lose him to a shelter. Here's what info I have to provide.\n\nHe's about 2 or 3 years so he's not old and he has been fixed. He does not respond to catnip or treats (due to him being born and raised and then living as a stray for a while). I have a small scratching post for him that's about 15 inches (which I'm guessing plays a huge part in it) that he has been encouraged to use and does not. I think a good start may be getting a larger one but if he doesn't use this one what are the chances he'd use the larger one?\n\nIn addition, we'd go with the spray method but I doubt it would work because a majority of the scratching takes place while we're out of the house so we can't spray him every time he does this. Think it's still a worthy avenue?\n\nI'm unwilling to declaw him so that's out of the question. I trim his nails when they get too sharp but should I be doing it more frequently? If so how often? \n\nDoes cat tape work? If so where do I buy it, how much does it usually cost, and how is it used and how does it work? Is it a viable solution in the long run?\n\nDoes putting something gross on it work like mustard powder or something akin to that? Would he just move onto scratching something else up...?\n\nPlease help me keep be baby. If you need any more info I'll add it asap. Please this is an emergency.",

    "description": "My 6-month-old kitten just got neutered, and now he is bloody hungry all the time. It's got to the point where he jumps up on the counter and tries to eat the dry food even as I'm putting it in his dish. \n\nI read that cats' appetites increase after sterilisation and was wondering how others have dealt with this - have you allowed them to eat more or trained them to accept the same amount of food? If the latter (which is what I plan to do), how did that work out?",

    "description": "I got my cat on May 2014 as a kitten. A year later she gave birth to 3 lovely kittens, and was a lovely mother towards them. They would cuddle up to her, and she would play fight with them. I saw they got on well and decided to keep all 3 kittens.\n\nLast august the mother's attitude towards them abruptly changed to express nothing but hate for them. She now hisses at them even from behind a door, whacks their faces to get them to go away, wont let them eat any food. And, she even goes looking for them just to attack them. The poor kittens don't fight back but are scared of her, which I'm not surprised about.\n\nUnfortunately this has created big issues in my house. All 3 kittens are on edge, the mother is on edge, I'm on edge. I live in a small house where there is not enough room to completely section them off from each other, except that the mother sleeps in the lobby now.\n\nI'll be moving house in about 2 months, and there will be a cat flap in the new house. I'm quite worried that the mother will block the kittens from entering it causing them to run away and find a home they feel more safe in. The only thing I can think of to help out all 4 cats is to find a new home for the mother cat before I move away...\n\nWhat do you guys think, is there any other solutions to make her get on well with her kittens again so she doesn't attack them and they can all live peacefully?",

Over the last couple months we noticed she sneezes and scratches her neck a bit. At first I thought she was just enjoying the scratch but its been pretty regular. She feels fine, now at a nice healthy weight (slightly chubby we pamper her) but I noticed her skin \"feels\" slightly dry? Around her neck I can't tell 100% if its in my mind or not. I took her collar off about a month ago to see if that was it but is persisted. She also here and there has these very tiny bumps kind of like scabs? I rarely notice them, they don't seem to bother her. About 2-3weeks ago we stopped sharing food with her while we ate dinner (I know horrible but we can't help ourselves denying her) physically she seems perfectly normal cat but with an itch on her neck a bunch. Should I be more worried? We were thinking maybe if was her food so I was wondering about suggestions for a food choices? Any information would be amazing! Thank you!",

    "description": "I have 3 kitties. Two are brother and sister and are about 13 or 14 years old. The other is a Male who is around 8 or 9.\n\nOur setup is:\n\nEach has their own food bowl.\nOne shared water dish.\nThree litter boxes.\n\nThe two boys fight and always have. Our 8yr old Male sprays around the house even though he is fixed (yes i have watched him do it.) They have had urinating outside the box issues for as long as i can remember. The female does not do it but the older Male does, and the younger male Sprays as i said above. For years they have been doing this and after going through our extra room and finding pretty much every surface covered in urine not long ago, I got fed up and I have taken to putting them all in one room to keep my house from being ruined. I can tell this is stressing them out to no end. I have tried to find a home for our younger male but no luck.\n\nHow can i stop all this urinating outside the box and fighting? I have tried litter boxes around the house, separate feeding areas, giving them nice beds and areas to sleep in, cleaning the boxes as soon as they use them, etc, and still the peeing. They have taken to peeing on the things i buy them to enjoy and frankly i'm tired of having to keep buying new things.\n\nI have had them checked at the vet and no problems with their urinary tracts. My vet suggested prozac for the younger male and i tried it on him with no luck. He seemed more unhappy while on it.\n\nAny advice or suggestions would be appreciated. I really would love to find a new home for our younger male as i think this would make everyone happier, but its just not happening.",

    "description": "It is annoying. I don't want it anymore.\n\nIt is not actually my cat! Don't worry. I am not a huge fan of cats!\n\nIt jumps through my window almost constantly. With my window closed, it gets too hot in here, so it has to be open. It will jump, straight away, onto my legs and fall asleep. If I am already asleep, it will come and cuddle up to me.\n\nIt 'begs' for my food when I am eating. It falls asleep on my towels, it destroys my rubbish bags.\n\nIt belongs to the neighbour, I think. I have had to remove tics from it, I have had to wash its matted fur, and I have had to feed it on occasion (yes, I know, that is bad of me when I am trying to get rid of it!).\n\nIts ear fell off IN MY ROOM after being infected. I had to stop the blood flow and tell somebody about it. (which is hard, because I don't speak the language here)\n\nI really can't have this cat keep coming back, because I don't want him to rely on me. The next person in this room may not be as nice as I am.\n\nSorry for hating on cats. If it were my own cat (which I am unlikely ever to own), I wouldn't mind him chilling. But, I know that once cats start to rely on somebody, they leave their old family. It happened to a cat of mine in the past, which was stolen.",

    "description": "I recently purchased the Aspen Pet LeBistro automatic feeder for my cat, Tally. I don't go away very often but I would like an automatic feeder for a variety of reasons. The primary one is to stop her waking me up at 5am to be fed. She is overweight and I want her to not associate me with food so that not only does she not wake me up, but so that she'll stop getting frantic at the thought of being fed every time I walk past her dish.\n\nAnyway, the feeder is not working out. Within an hour she had figured out that she can put her paw inside the feeder and knock out a few bits of kibble at a time. She would spend anywhere from 10-20 minutes doing this and eating as much as she wanted, so I'm returning it.\n\nLooking for recommendations from others who use automatic feeders! TIA!",

    "title": "Gf's new cat won't stop following me around, stressing me out. Advice?",
    "description": "Hi All,\n\nMy GF and I have been living together in a one bedroom apartment and she recently adopted a cat (3 yrs). I didn't want a pet at all, but knowing how much my GF has wanted a cat her entire life, I couldn't say \"no\" to her and at least give it a try. My experience with cats in the past led me to believe that they are creatures who stay to themselves for the most part and are independent, so I went along thinking \"OK, no problem if the cat is just there and doesn't bother me.\"\n\nHowever, our new cat is the complete 180. He is everything a cat lover would want and exactly what a cat-phobic person would dislike. The cat simply cannot stop following me around, which is causing me a lot of stress - he seems to love me more than my GF who is actually the one taking care of him.\n\nExamples of his behavior and lifestyle changes it has forced me to make, stressing me out:\n\n1. My computer office area is in the living room. Anytime I want to sit down and use the computer to study/work, the cat will inevitably jump onto the desk, walk over the keyboard, into my lap. Even if I carry it away or walk away, it comes following me right back and the process repeats. I have not been able to get any work done.\n\n2. Use of kitchen area - The cat has way too much energy and jumps all over everything it can find. I'm afraid to cook because I fear the cat will follow me, and jump onto the stove or countertop while my hands are full. As I am a mild germaphobe, it already stresses me out enough that his paws are all over our surfaces, and I definitely can't handle touching the cat while touching raw food. This has made it impossible to cook.\n\n3. Use of living room - this might sound trivial, but when I want to sit back and watch TV / play a video game, the cat will sit on the table in front of me and try to either jump onto my lap or head butt my hands the entire time. It's distracting and has made me want to use the living room less.\n\nThese are just but a few examples of how the cat's clingy-ness and desire to constantly follow me around has forced me to make living adjustments. Being able to use my office area and cook are the main issues, but all the other little things add up. I appreciate that the cat loves me so, but it's just not for me - I need my alone time and would rather watch him chill taking a nap over in the corner.\n\nSo All, I need advice. Is there ANY way I can get the cat to be more independent and stop following me around everywhere? And, secondarily, any way to train him not to jump all over the place? Or is this just part of his DNA and will forever be like this? I've already tried moving the cat back to his bed and/or ignoring him, but he inevitably ends up coming right back. Anytime he is not taking a nap, he is following me literally everywhere. I am starting to think that maybe it's not working out and I am not apt to be a cat co-owner for the next 10+ years. The cat is really cute, but I feel like it maybe deserves better owners who are cat-lovers and can deal with its clingyness and high energy. The adoption center said we may return him within 2 weeks and I'm sure he would get adopted. At the same time, I don't want to disappoint my GF. I feel stuck.\n\nTLDR: I didn't really WANT a cat, but GF did so I gave in. Cat is incredibly clingy and won't stop following me around, changing my lifestyle. Don't know what to do or whether I should even be a co-owner of a cat.",

    "description": "I'm getting a new couch delivered tomorrow. I've spent, for me, a fair amount of coin on this purchase as it's my only major furniture purchase in the past couple years, and I don't want to ruin it right out of the gate. A few years ago we got new blinds for the patio and the cats just love to chew on them, effectively ruining them, but I survived.\n\nGenerally, they're good about not scratching every little thing in the house. Mostly their tree, and sometimes the carpet on a custom play area because the carpet is kind of similar (our mistake). We trim their nails whenever they start getting caught on things, which is probably every month or 2.\n\nWhat product/trick/whatever can I put _on_ the couch corners to prevent them from sharpening themselves, but that also doesn't ruin the couch in exchange. \n\nI've heard of putting double-sided tape, or some scent cats hate (peppermint?)  Does anybody have any suggestions that have worked for them? \n\nEdit: We picked up a scratching tower and another small movable thing. Splashed some catnip on them and let the kitties have a good day. Next day we got the couch, set it all up, looks pretty skookum. We trimmed their nails (they were overdue anyway), put the new scratching posts away from the couch lest they associate by proximity, and covered the external corners of the couch in double-sided tape. Their large tree/tower is right behind the couch, but they predominantly scratch only the top posts, so we're not really worried. As a final measure, we got a spray bottle of \"anti-scratch\" stuff to put in the other areas that aren't covered by tape.\n\nHopefully that should curb any problems before they happen.",

My feeling are that if you cannot afford to even see a vet to check on an injury/illness you probably cannot afford to have a cat.  I know that people who cannot afford vet care probably still love their cat very much but I feel like it is not fair to the cat to take on the responsibility of owning them if you cannot afford to have them treated when they inevitably get sick or injured. I am just wondering if other people also feel this way? The internet in general seems to be really supportive to people when they say that \"x\" happened but I cannot afford a vet.

    "description": "Hi, first time poster here, would really appreciate some help! My family cat, aged around 8 years old, has a myriad of health problems. He had cat flu as a kitten which messed him up, leading to a loss of teeth due to gingivitis and breathing problems. He lives in our garden but he has an elevated bed in the central heating shed and doesn't like being in the house for too long.\n\nHowever, there's always some other tom giving him trouble. He's neutered but he obviously wants to defend his home so he gets in fights. He's had his belly ripped open, an open wound in his neck, but his last injury is just more of a psychological issue.\n\nSo he had a patch of hair torn off by the other cat, and my dad brought him to the vet just in case, but the vet said it should be fine once the hair grows back. However, the poor cat is over grooming and the patch now looks shiny and raw. \n\nI was thinking of applying aloe vera gel since it worked on my pony when she had rain scald but I don't want to make it worse. Having shelled out for two vet trips this year alone, we'd like to know if we can avoid getting professional help for him, if we can prevent it getting worse.\n\nHe's a lovely, kind cat who rarely scratchs, so don't hesitate to suggest even something that a normal cat would be a real pain about. He's a shorthair generic cat whose parentage can only be described as feral. Hope you can help:)",

    "description": "A friend of mine has had her cat for nearly 20 years and has a feeling it's sun is finally setting.  It's now beginning to show signs of chronic pain and losing weight.  My friend would be absolutely devastated if she wakes up to find her cat has passed away, but she's also not able to bring herself to have the cat put to sleep to end its suffering.  She also works two jobs and has no time to really spend quality end-of-life loving time with it.\n\nIf I didn't already have a family with pets, I'd offer to take her cat to care for and pamper it for its last days and take it to a vet for a humane, peaceful euthanasia, sparing my friend the responsibility of putting down a loved one.  Are there people or \"sunset adoption\" groups that can do this sort of thing?  It would mean the world to my friend.\n\nWe're near Sacramento, CA, if it matters.",

    "description": "For context, I live in the UK. I've had a cat for a year now, and even though she's pretty set with her current food brand, I occasionally look around for better food choices. A few years ago, I used to feed a stray cat some canned food. From what I remember, the cans had actual chunks of fish in them. Like big meaty  pieces that you get when you pull a fish apart and remove the spine. You could actually see the depressions in the meat where the bones would have been. That cat really loved it.\n\nNow all I can find is the same brown colored mush extruded into little cubes and set in jelly or something. Where is the good cat food? Why can't I find it? Or am I doing something wrong here?",

    "description": "I adopted my adorable ball of fluff about four months ago and at first most things were ok. There were a few typical misbehaviors here and there which I worked to correct but he was generally doing ok. But once I moved house and brought him with me, everything changed.\n\nDespite buying him several cat trees and posts and placing them all around the house, he insists on climbing all the tables, counters, chairs, and other objects instead. We have tried every form of positive and negative re-enforcement we can think of and none of them have met with more than limited and temporary success.\n\nDespite purchasing him almost two dozen toys of various kinds, including treat and catnip toys, he continues to play with anything and everything else he can in the house. This includes things that are fragile, breakable, and/or hazardous to his health. Additionally the vast majority of these items are in places he's not supposed to go. And again we have tried every positive and negative re-enforcement technique we can find to stop this behavior, but no success \n\nI adopted my cat in hopes he could help me relieve stress and aid my depression but he has done everything opposite. He's climbed all over tables and knocked over many decorations, recently breaking a couple of them, and chewing on others along with cables and other items around the house. I don't know what to do with this cat anymore. He refuses to learn anything and it's causing a huge amount of stress and worsening my previously mentioned depression. The only solution I can think of is to give him away to somebody else or take him to our local humane society shelter.\n\nPlease if you know anything that can help tell me. I would prefer not to give up my first cat since my childhood but I don't see another option anymore.",

    "description": "Hello!\n\nI'm thinking of adopting a cat but I'm looking for some outside opinions and advice on whether or not it would be a mature and responsible decision.\n\nI have been jointly responsible for a cat before, but I moved several hours journey away when my relationship ended and my (kind and responsible) ex is now the sole caretaker. I miss my cat and would like to get some feline companionship back into my life and offer a loving home to an animal in need.\n\nThe issue that's worrying me about taking responsibility for a cat is that my job will soon be taking me away from home for up to about a working week at a time, between one and three times per month depending on how busy things are. As I live alone I'm not sure if this is too long to leave a cat lonely and bored or whether a more independently spirited one would enjoy the freedom.\n\nI do have friends who could swing by but it seems unfair to ask them to be responsible for my cat when I would know from the outset that this isn't just the odd few occasions; it's my job for the foreseeable future. It would be probably too much work to ask them to take up on my behalf.\nPerhaps water, litter and food wouldn't be an issue with auto feeders/waterers and an outdoor cat.\n\nWhen I was at home the cat would be greatly loved and appreciated, but is that enough? Is it a better life than would be had in a shelter?\nFellow \"cat-people\", would you give me your thoughts?",

    "description": "So I'm fostering two kittens (about 2-3 months old) until their adoption Jan 10th. My dad found them at work without a mother. I found a coworker who is obsessed with cats, and had her 14 year old cat passed away recently and she's willing to take both of them in. There's one male kitten and one female. They are already potty trained, they let us give them belly rubs and sometimes they even fall asleep in our arms. On a rare occasion they will hiss if we scare them with our unexpected movement.\nMy family's cat was also found by my dad as a kitten. He's about one and a half years old, very energetic but hates being held and tries to escape anyone who holds me. He's never been aggressive towards us, he maybe hissed 5 times this whole year. \nWe are keeping the kittens in my room, and my cat knows that so he will scratch at the door all night. The kittens try to play with him under the door. I left a small space inbetween the door for them to sniff one another, and surprisingly there was no sniffing and my cat kept making high pitch purrs and meows.\nOur main concern is disease, these two kittens have not been taken to the vet and have no shots while ours is. Is it possible for either one to get sick from further interaction? Or is it safe for them to all play rough? My cat would really use some company for a little bit and I feel like the kittens would benefit from an interaction with an older cat.\nWhat should I do?",

    "description": "So I have a home to call my own and am wanting to add a new addition of a cat/kitten to our new home. I have been scouring the internet to try and find the proper methods to introduce the new addition to our home without becoming overwhelmed. Many articles state to provide a \"sanctuary\" for the cat to start off in with all of the amenities (food, litter, scratch post, bed) until they feel comfortable to venture into the rest of the home.\n\nWe have picked out our master bath as the sanctuary as it is large enough to accommodate all of the amenities plus space so it is not all stacked on one another (i.e. the food will be far enough away from the litter). Our concern is that we will eventually want to spread these amenities to their desired location, but none of the articles talk about how to accomplish this.\n\nA few questions/concerns that I have not been able to find sound advice for:\n1. Most articles state to not move the litter box, but we do not want to litter box permanently in our bathroom, but in the hall bathroom (more central to the home). How do we accomplish this move without confusion and stress on our little one?\n\n2. Our master bath is on the farthest end of the home (1800sq ft) from the kitchen where the food and water will go. Also the living room is at the end of the hallway outside of our bedroom. Is it best that we do not provide that sanctuary for our new addition and put all of the amenities in the desired location and help her navigate to them? (If she is not too scared to follow us?)\n\nBasically, I completely understand the need for a sanctuary for our new cat and am willing to take time to adjust (don't want to have the cat fully conform to our ways, we can compromise) but I do not want to make it stressful trying to move the amenities in the areas that make sense (i.e. Litter in the proper bathroom, food in the kitchen, scratching post/condo in the living room where we will be most of the time, etc.)\n\nAny advice would be much appreciated so that we can ensure a proper transition for our new addition.\n\n*PS* We do not have any other animals or family members (my wife and I only) so there won't be an overwhelming amount of people that can be stressful.",

We got her some kitten food and she didn't stop eating for like 10 times. \n\nOur parking lot is very busy so I had no doubt she would get him by a car within the hour of being outside. I had work for another 7 hours so I brought the cat inside and put her in one of the empty rooms at our office with food and water. I checked on her every 30 minutes throughout the day. (Employer was fine with this)\n\nTook her home, gave her a bath, and fed her. My girlfriend and me ended up really getting attached to the kitten. We bought her a collar, some toys, a litter box, and all. And 2 weeks later she sleeps next to us at night. My girlfriend sent me this Snapchat the other day[Image](http://i.imgur.com/jfwKOTd.jpg)\n\nI'm just kind of in shock with myself from going from not caring for cats at all, to caring for this one so much.

    "title": "Questions about transitioning an outdoor cat to indoor",
    "description": "I'm house/cat sitting for one of my supervisors who just recently adopted a cat. She was a stray that showed up at work that he eventually took it. She's gotten adjusted, gets taken to the vet, he's had her for maybe 6 months now. She was clearly abandoned before, and probably was an indoor outdoor cat. Now she spends most of her time outdoors, coming inside only when someone is home. All of us at work are trying to convince my supervisor that he needs to keep her inside, but he doesn't think it's possible and thinks she'll be unhappy. She's trained my supervisor very, very well. He'll do whatever she wants no matter what it is. He apparently asked his vet and the vet said some cats won't transition, which didn't help our cause. We are park rangers and know the havoc cats reap on the environment. We also have raccoons, great horned owls, foxes, and coyotes. He insists that she doesn't go far away from his house and is safe when she goes underneath the house, but I've seen her at night down the road. She also got ringworm, probably from being underneath his house. I did an experiment last night and kept her inside for a while instead of leaving the door open like my supervisor normally does. She was clearly distressed and restless after just a few minutes. She would walk around meowing constantly, but when I petted her she seemed to calm down. She had no interest in playing with me. All she wanted was to be let outside. She clawed at the door and at the blinds, basically freaking out. \n\nIs there any hope for her to make the transition? I wanted to give my supervisor information on how to do it. He knows the risks letting her outside and had voiced concern for her before, but is afraid she'll be unhappy inside and tear his house apart. He does not have any idea how to go about doing it. He had never had a pet before, and is a middle aged single man. I've looked at some sites, but would appreciate some feedback from you guys. I grew up with cats, so I know what I would do, but since he has never had an animal before, he views my methods as somewhat... insensitive.  \n\nI would really appreciate any feedback.",

What about our cats? \n\nI'm writing to you all because one of my beloved old ladies is not doing so well. She developed diabetes, which we discovered a few months ago. In the past three days,  it's been non stop with our local vet after discovering she's going through ketoacidosis. I want to make sure she knows I love her as she's struggling. I know it's only a matter of time before she either passes on her own or the vet decides it's best for her to cross the rainbow bridge. \n\nSo tell me your stories or thoughts on the best of a kitty's last days.",

    "description": "Hi all, I need advice. My cat's behavior lately has been terrible. Since it started getting cold, my cat has been hiding in his happy place for all of the day except about an hour in which he is very sedate unless play is initiated. He eats, then goes back to hiding. I'm assuming he's hibernating or something. His general attitude in the last 2 months has gone to shit and he's become extremely antisoial and scratches a lot.\n\nMy issue comes that he is randomly just freaking the heck out for no reason when I'm holding him gently and securely, scratches and digs, then runs away to his hiding spot. This bit is recent, within about the last 2 months. He's normally a bit skittish but this is different. He's not a fan of people coming over and does hide, but lately he's been tearing ass through the house to hide from the front door even jiggling a little bit.\n\nThere has been no change in his food, environment, people, schedules, etc, everything is the same as it was 6 months ago except the weather. I am at the end of my rope with this cat. I've had him for a year and a half and he is just such an ass now. No matter how much I am quiet and loving, he just freaks the fuck out.\n\nshort stats:\n2, neutered, vet said \"excellent health\" 4 months ago, inside only with no will to go out the front door but loves windows.",

I have no idea what to do, but it's gotten to the point where we're embarrassed to ask people over because of the stench that greets you at the front door. We have a nice little patio area, but the couple of times we've tried to use it, we're driven back inside by the smell.\n\n\nWe are not cat experts by any means, and we don't know how to discourage the cats from entering the planter to do their business.\n\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!

I'm assuming he likes the warmth and the slight vibration of it (it's always turned on).\n\nI researched this to see if it might be unhealthy but couldn't find a definitive answer and opinions seemed to vary. I was considering closing it so he couldn't sleep on it anymore because for some reason I get the feeling it's not good for him to be on it that much and he obviously won't limit himself to 1 hour per day or anything reasonable, he'll be on it at least 4-5 hours a day (plus however long he's on it while I'm asleep) unless I close it. I bought him one of those cat hotpads but for some reason he no longer likes it and only wants to sleep on the computer.\n\nHe does move around so he's not getting burned or anything (at least not that I can tell, and he walks around like he's fine). But I wonder if the excessive heat and radiation (or whatever computers emit) might cause some kind of internal damage? I was hoping someone here might know. Thanks.",

Today he ate part of one that was crawling with maggots. \n\nIs this normal behaviour? I'm not convinced he's the one killing them, rather I think he's finding dead birds on the ground since apparently maggots take hours to hatch and he brings me these birds within 20 mins of being let out.

He is spayed, has a chip, yearly check-ups and whatnot. And needless to say he gets all the love he could ever need.\n\nThing is that a week ago i noticed he had part of the tail swollen and a small wound. I ASSumed that he got into a fight or something and since after a couple of days it seemed to get better i kind of shrugged it off (MISTAKE! Cat bites can get real nasty!). But today it was clear that this would not heal on its own; he seemed to be able to move the tail just fine but at one point it now felt *too thin*  and upon freaking out i legged it to the vet. That could only mean necrosis. I was right.\n\nIt only took one \"it'll be alright\" decision to put his life under severe risk (he could have easily developed a septicaemia) and i'm the only one to blame. And the pain he must have gone through.\n\nBottom line: ALWAYS keep an eye on your cats(s)!!

She seems to enjoy playing with him (for a while), and has only let out a couple of small, seemingly normal sounds but he is just all over her every time I put her down.\n\nHe has never shown any aggression towards anyone, but he and I play quite rough together. He bites my hands quite hard (never hard enough to draw blood) but his claws can really slice me up at times, which is not intentional by him. But he also gets plenty of affection, so it's never been just all action for him.\n\nI am relatively new to having cats in the family, so as a newbie I am overly paranoid. But should I be worried about the rough play or should I just let her handle herself? Should I chastise him or just let him be? Should I do anything at all or just supervise?\n\nI know that their relationship will change as they get to know each other, but yeah any advice at all would be fantastic! The female is yet to be desexed, by the way. She will be very soon.\n\n[Obi the boy](http://imgur.com/ru5gq3P)\n\n[Ivy the girl](http://imgur.com/i5G8sjc)\n\nEDIT: The thing that worries me the most is that he seems to keep going for her throat and neck. Not like in for the kill, he doesn't seem to be aggressively doing it, but I am just paranoid something could go wrong. He is very persistent. \n\nAlso possibly of note, my boy kitten never had a mother. His litter was found with no mother. Not sure if that is relevant or not.\n\n",

    "description": "Both my boys, Sherlock and Watson, got fixed today. They are doing really well, but the clinic told me to keep them confined, and keep the cone of shame on both of them. They hate it. I've set up food, water, litter box, and towels to keep them comfy in the bathroom. How long should I keep them in there? Sherlock is still a little shaky from the anesthesia, and is bleeding a little. I already called the clinic about that, and they said it is normal to bleed slightly because they didn't use stitches or glue, and try to keep him from exerting himself too much. Any advice y'all can give me on how to take care of these fur balls? I don't remember having to do all this when I had my females spayed. Obligatory picture: http://i.imgur.com/cs5pCB7.jpg",

They get a long fine, they're not super affectionate, but a few times a day they will clean a play with each other, the other times they are totally indifferent. sometimes they'll sleep close together some times they wont, doesn't really matter to them.\n\nmy room mates girlfriend is going away for a few days, so we are taking in her cat a Siamese, also neutered, very playful. All three are roughly the same age, a year to a year and a half.\n\nWe just introduced them to each other and it didnt end well, my 2 immediately started swatting and hissing, quite violently. i separated my 2, brought them to my room and closed the door, where they started to attack each other.\n\nmy 2 have only seen one other animal, a dog while at the vet and they behaved the same way, attacking each other.\n\nI dont know if they are just anti social jerk or theyre just scared? Is there any way i can help this process a long? or is it a lost casue?\n\nHalp!!",

I went to the bathroom and noticed my right hand and arm were covered in hives. I took off my shirt and saw hives all over my abdomen. I can't think of anything else that could have caused this. Is it possible that I'm allergic to this one particular cat?\n\nI certainly don't get this way around my cat or my girlfriend's cats.

    "title": "Any tips for exercising a sick kitten?",
    "description": "I have a VERY lethargic kitten who is about 2 months old, and I am worried he is not developing properly because he won't play no matter how I try to tempt him. He's been sick for about 2 weeks, and while his appetite wavers (but is growing steadily), his energy remains fairly low. During a \"high\" energy day, he follows me around the house (but won't play).\n\nA little backstory: \n\n* I found him at 4 weeks, abandoned by his mother\n\n* He's had trouble eliminating despite stimulation (typic of kittens who aren't with their mother when weaning)\n\n* His sickness began 2 weeks ago today. He ate a piece of fluff from his toy, vomited it up, and was subsequently constipated &amp; vomiting a lot that day.I took him to the vet, who gave me probiotics and simple food, and he eliminated the next day.\n\n* His appetite was slow to return (and he's been a lot pickier about food) but when I started giving him high calorie gel, it came back en force on Monday, but his lethargy has not waned.\n\n* I took him back to the vet who told me that he looks well (gums good, not constipated, though a little dehydrated) to play with him and \"enrich his environment\", which I have doneâ€”but he has NO interest in playing. She also gave me a gel that boosts kitten's immune systems. \n\n* She also said he might have FIP, which I don't think is the case, but may well be if he doesn't get better. \n\nPersonally I think he's having a hard time getting over the constipation/vomiting/appetite issue, which is affecting his energy. But he's been eating well for a few days now with no sign of energy increase.\n\nI've bought myriad toys, tried games and things he use to love to play with (my fingers and feet esp.), but nothing excites him. He just wants to lie down, or lie on me. \n\nI am particularly worried that muscles will atrophy. He jumped down off a low sofa last night and ate it. I need to help him get his strength up, but need some fresh ideasâ€”what I'm trying doesn't seem to be working.",

This current one being the worst in which he did a couple attacks on my legs from behind which left some nice, bloody scratches and me fuming and confused. (on the last attack I threw a small coloring book at him afterwards,  wrong I know buy ouch dammit!) As soon as I would turn around after his attacks, his hair would raise up and he'd be very vocal.\n\n As he's grown up he has gotten wilder but has not shown the level of aggression to others that he shows me. I don't get it because just yesterday he was rubbing along my legs, lazing around beside me etc. after one of his attacks. \n\nIs this just an uneutered issue or is it something else?\n\nAlso, there is an older fixed female cat and a fixed male dog in the home. He bothers the cat and they have scuffles because she wants to be left alone and as for the dog,  he doesn't bother the cat since he tried to hitch a ride on the dogs back haha :/ He also spends half his time shut in a bedroom when he can't be supervised so I'm sure that's no help. \n\nAnyway, just looking for some advice or tips I can follow for my stay here.\n\n(excuse shitty mobile format)",

    "description": "Hey everybody,\nMy 4 1/2 year old male cat has very suddenly started to have UTI issues (peeing outside litterbox when he never used to, straining when in litterbox) and I was hoping you could help me out.\nHe started having trouble last Friday(6 days ago). He was peeing outside the litterbox, and straining in ways that he had not before. I booked an appointment for him on the following Tuesday (2 days ago) so I could have him looked at, and get whatever tests the vet would recommend. Well, lo and behold, on Monday night (3 days ago) he stopped having problems and was doing completely fine. I brought him into the vet, and she said that he was acting completely normal, and that despite a couple small things (weight, a very slight heart murmur) there wasn't too much cause for concern. We did do a urinalysis, and when she called me back later that day, she told me that she'd like to do another about a month from now to check on a slight residual blood cell count found in his urine.\nI thought everything was good, until yesterday. Yesterday, all of the problems resurfaced, and he is still having UTI issues. I felt like he had lost them just in time for the appointment, and then regained the right afterward.\nI have tried the following treatments, and continue to do so: 1/2 tsp of apple cider vinegar, and an all wet food diet.\nThere is no blood in the urine, and he seems to be passing in his doses throughout the house, a large amount of urine.\nHelp!",

The guy who caught her at my dads work was a psycho who hates cats and he threatened to kill her unless my dad took her in ( my dad found the male kitten a day later).

Usually sleep next to my pillow at night, follow me around when I go outside, sits in my lap, etc.\n\nThe female is mixrace, more shy, mainly my sisters cat. Dosnt like to be picked up / be in lap, but is keen to being petted.\n\nOur \"problem\" is that the male cat is some time hostile, as my sister claims, towards guests and other family members. \nA discussion sparked after he jumped onto our guests chest, and lay there for 10-15 minutes behing scratched under chin and behind ears. He then started showing subtle signs that he wasn't liking it anymore. He then hit/scratched the guests hand and when guest tried to release his hand by moving it towards the cat, he did a soft bite on the hand, no blood or any major marks were put on our guest and he didn't say anything.\n\nIt was later when my sister claimed our male cat was raised poorly (by me, as its \"my cat\"), and she had raised her cat well (because it never bites anyone).\n\nTo add, the male cat has never attacked anyone \"just to attack\", he has only hit/scratched/bit guests/family that has been \"annoying\" him, or misstaken a shoe-string for a toy. etc.\n\nI claim that its just how cats are, but my sister says otherwise.\nWe havn't had cats before in the family, so asking you guys for answers, is this normal male cat behaviour, or is there something we can do?",

It is Christmas, and the emergency vet is the only thing open as far as vets, I called them, and she said it sounded like a respiratory infection, and that it could wait until Monday when my normal vet opened again, as long as he wasn't mouth breathing or panting.

    "description": "Hi /r/cats\n\nI've come here seeking advice from the many people of this subreddit. \n\nMy family owns a cat named Bella that is about 7 years old. Bella was a really loving cat, she would fall asleep in the lap of just about anyone with little to no fear. \n\nIt was about 5 years after that when we adopted a second cat, Chloe (she was ~6 months old at the time). Bella really didn't like Chloe. From day one she was hissing and snarling at her, however we had read that this was to be expected, so we thought we could wait it out and everything would be okay. \n\nEverything isn't okay. It's been about 2 years since we adopted Chloe, and things have gotten worse, rather than better. The second Chloe enters a room that Bella was in already she starts to hiss and look as if she is very scared. \n\nChloe doesn't help the situation at all. I can't tell if she's \"playing\" or just being a nuisance because she stalks Bella and will jump out at her (again, it seems playful, but I'm not a cat psychologist) and this really freaks Bella out. \n\nThere are also a few other things that happened before the adoption of Chloe that I could see as somewhat traumatic and could cause a behavioural change. About 3 years after we got Bella, we adopted a dog. Bella wasn't fond of the dog, but she made it clear from day one that the house was her turf, and the dog doesn't bother her and it doesn't really cause any hissing/snarling. \n\nSecond, when she was taken into the vet to be fixed, she also had her claws removed at the same time. My mom is convinced this was \"day 1\" of the behavioural change because after that it was next to impossible to gt her to the vet (we can't get her in a crate because she associates it with the vet, and the last time she was there she shit on the examination table, forcing the veterinarian to have to wear oven mitt type gloves to not get bit). It was after the vet visits that we noticed she didn't trust any humans other than those in my family. \n\nBasically I'm just wondering if anyone has any ideas as to how I can possibly fix the way she is. I feel bad because its like she's constantly living in a state of stress having to worry about these things. Any advice would be appreciated. \n\nTL;DR was told my cats would be friends eventually.. It's been 2 years and its worse than the day I brought cat #2 home",

Not to mention the time as well, but I can manage to 3,5 hours if I stay at one of my friends who lives \"nearby\".  However I don't believe that it's a good idea to buy a cat that has never met you or \"not choose you as his/her human\". What do you guys think?\n\n\n",

    "description": "About 3 months ago I started noticing little flashes of black fur.  First it was in the field.  Then it was near the outbuildings (I live in a rural area).  It slowly started moving closer to the house until one day I opened the door and there was a little black cat sitting by the back door.  As soon as it saw me, startled, it ran away.\n\nThis is when I started feeding the cat.  It has been 2 months and every morning when I am out feeding the horses I also feed the cat (near the out buildings, far from the house).  I even adjusted my schedule to go out slightly before sunrise so the cat could eat in the dark, as it wasn't trusting enough to eat while it was light.\n\nThis morning I wen't out to feed the animals and lo and behold that puffy black cat is sitting by his food bowl meowing at me.  Let it be known until now I have been feeding this cat for a few months and have yet only seen his shadowy figure seemingly evaporate into the snow.  I get a few feet from him and he hides in the haystack.  I put the food in his bowl back up a few feet and he darts out and starts eating making only what I can describe as a sound somewhere crossed between gorging and purring.\n\nWhat is better this morning I gave him a can of fancy food (his first ever).  I was afraid it was going to freeze before he got to it.  I guess not :).  A while ago I decided to name him Phantom.  Come spring I was planning on humanely trapping him and taking him to be fixed and get his shots.  But this may not be needed anymore as we are taking steps which will hopefully lead to some trust being formed.  I am not sure if Phantom is a guy or a gal yet but time will tell.\n\nI am just so ecstatic right and I thought I would share it with you all.  Happy holidays Reddit.",

    "description": "For too long now two cats have been loitering onto my property and harassing my indoor cats through our windows, urinating on things and just being a nuisance. One of these cats has gotten into an altercation with one of my cats while I allowed my cats in our backyard while supervising them to not exit our property. I was compelled to write this after one of the cats had a swiping match at our window with our biggest male cat where it destroyed our screen from constantly clawing it, it's difficult to relax when this cat is shrieking during these scuffles which just feels so ironic since it acts as though it's defending it's territory that's our property which I'd figure it would realize after being chased off by myself many times.\n\nI'm prepared to set a raccoon cage in our backyard and trap the cat then take it to the shelter as my attempts at scaring it off have had no effect at stopping it from returning. Are there any other alternatives besides bringing it to the shelter? A friend of mine suggested driving some distance away then letting it go to avoid having the owners (if these cats have any) from retrieving them and allowing the cycle to continue, I'm not sure that this is the most humane method nor legal though the shelter route could result in the cats being euthanized were no one to claim them.\n\nRegardless I'm pretty much set on trapping these cats to prevent this from continuing and was curious to if anyone else faced a similar problem.",

    "description": "Me and my wife adopted our first cat(dandi) in April and then adopted a second one(Carl) in November. We thought they would get along well because they are both snowshoe Siamese. We did all the introductions and they seem to get along well, until Carl gets over playful and pounces on dandi. My questoins are:\n1) is it a good sign when both use the same litter box? Carl will almost exclusively use dandi's. We have 2 boxes and Carl will wait until he can go to dandi's to potty. Dandi doesn't seem to mind much but we are constantly cleaning just to make sure she will go in it. \n2) Carl is overly playful. The adoption agency said he was 10 months but he looks and plays like a kitten. He will be nice and then kind of snap and pounce on dandi, she hates it and starts to scream until me or my wife break them up. Carl also tries to play with me and my wife's appendages, it's gotten to the point where we can't pet him because he thinks we're playing and will attack our hands. I can tell that he is not attacking viciously. We try to play with him with toys but he will lay down and stop playing. Is there a way to curb this behavior/ what is the best way to get him to stop biting us?\n\nDandi:\nhttp://imgur.com/045nOFe\n\nCarl:\nhttp://imgur.com/rpE3nad",

The pound didn't tell us much about her except that she was 10 months old and was born a feral cat and stayed that way \"for a short time\" before the pound picked her up.\n\nApparently she also had 1 previous owner who had her \"for a short time\" before returning her for refusing to use the liter box. We decided to adopt her and after she transitioned to living in the house she became friendly and gentle. Doesn't mind being picked up and petted but, as expected, we had the same problem.\n\nWhats happening is the cat began throwing up everywhere multiple times a day, she also used the restroom anywhere she was with the liter box very accessible. We were told that she was trained for the literbox but, despite that, she doesn't acknowledge it.\n\nWe took her to the vet to get her examined and the vet didn't find anything but gave her some general digestion and stomach meds anyways just in case. After about a couple more weeks she stopped throwing up and now occasionally pees in the literbox but still refuses to poop in there and sometimes she goes back to disacknowledging it all-together.\n\nWe tried an extra literbox as we heard sometimes cats like to have 2 but that didn't work and we've tried catnip both in natural and liquid form to try and attract her to certain areas like the literbox but she seems to not even notice its there.\n\nWe love her and we're happy we got her but after several weeks of trying to figure this out I'd thought I'd come here to maybe get some ideas.

To me, she looks malnourished. She used to eat almost a small can of wet food a day and the past three days, she's only eaten about a fourth. Her mobility has been compromised, and she doesn't walk fast or easily, but I'm not sure if it's just aging or if she's in pain. She, however, was actually somewhat alert this morning, and is eating a little, but she still does not look very happy at all. She has been sleeping nearly 23 hours each day and is not very interested in being pet or held, even though she normally is very social. \n\nSo how do I know when it's time to take her to the vet? I'd like to be able to identify what is just aging (she's pretty old) or if there is something seriously wrong with her that needs addressing.

    "description": "Hello! I am not familiar with this subreddit so apologies in advance if I get a bit lost.\n\nAnyways, recently I went to visit my cousin who got a new cat. I am not entirely sure she was a kitten but she doesn't look mature either. \n\nI was there with my other 3 cousins who are also very excited about the kitten. After meeting, she appears to be very comfortable with them too! Not wanting to overcrowd the cat, I waited until all my cousins have left her alone before playing with her.\n\nBut when I put my hand down, she grabbed it and bit me :( after biting, she licked my thumb and carried on biting again. All the whilst holding onto my hand. \n\nI don't know a lot about cats but the hard biting was not a good sign. And I'm sure I wasn't being threatening to the kitten in any way either. I know the grabbing was playful but the biting is worrying. It wasn't a gentle bite. Could the kitten not know her strength? Or could she be teething or something? \n\nAny suggestions on her behaviour would be very helpful, thank you!",

    "description": "TL;DR I'm unsure of how common this is and am wondering what signs/symptoms cats I should have looked for. I'm hoping someone will tell me that things sound like they will be OK. \n\nI am currently several states away from home for the holidays. I have a fantastic cat sitter who called me yesterday to tell me that my 7 year old DSH was not well. He had pulled the tablecloth off the table, made a nest, and was vomiting profusely. On top of that, he was not coming out to say hello - this is a *very* outgoing cat. The cat sitter was concerned and took him to the emergency vet, who is a different one than I've used in the past. X-Ray shows an inflamed colon, but everything else was fine. The blood panel showed nothing wrong. But the vet said the amount he was vomiting was very alarming. Not being there to see him for myself, I elected to have him stay in the emergency hospital for the night for observation. I cannot get the vet to tell me anything - she will move between \"bloodwork is fine so let's treat the symptoms of colitis\" to \"this is very alarming\". I asked if perhaps he ate something toxic (which would not have been like him). She said, \"who knows\". Her bedside manner over the phone sucks. So I'm driving home to make sure everything is fine. I'm about 10 hours from home currently, and am really freaked out. \n\nFrom the limited info I have, does it sound like it is super serious? I have 2 other cats at home that are fine, but what symptoms should I be looking for before the vomiting and hiding, just in case they have it too?",

    "description": "I still don't understand what happened. Yesterday the best pet I ever had passed away trying to catch his breath. In June of this year I rescued two kittens from terrible conditions at a hoarders house. One of his cats had kittens and many where dieing. He did work at my wife's work and we had agreed to adopt a few. When I got both them they had fleas. We got rid of the fleas and they where seemed fine but one passed about a week later the day before I was going to take them to the vet. Then other cat Felix made it and turned into the most loving pet I have ever had in my life. Every day I would come home and he would run to the door to great me. I always thought he seemed to breath strangely I took him to the vet many times to get his shots and be nurtured. They said he was fine. Well for Christmas I went to my parents home and this wasn't the first time Felix had been there. As I live very close to them and I took Felix everywhere as he loved to travel. At my parents house we kept him in my bedroom as my parents have 3 pom dogs and 4 older adult cats. His heart seemed to beat fast when he would go explore and one of the dogs tried to play with him. Before his death I had my two year old niece in the room and was playing guitar with her this seemed to scare Felix like vacuum cleaners did so I stopped. He seemed fine after and I even gave him a hug and pet him to try to calm him down. I let him down to go to the bathroom. Then after a while he went under my bed. I went to go help my dad with something. After a few minutes I heard my wife and sister scream saying something was happening to Felix and I needed to take him to the vet asap. Well I ran upstairs where he was struggling to breath and his nose from foaming. We rushed him to the vet and I tired to give him mouth to mouth I didn't want to believe he was gone but he was announced dead by the vet as soon as we arrived. Can anyone help me understand what happened was it the stress from being at my parents home Felix was 8 months old. And taken perfect care off...",

    "description": "Hey, long story short: I'm a vet student, on a previous rotation a stray cat came in, stayed for a while but didn't get a home, was gonna be euthanized so I adopted him. He's 7-10 we think, now neutered, was very thin, thinks every meal is his last and gobbles it down, typical stray. \n\nI have another cat at home, a 3 year spayed female who's been perfect and I love very much. They get along well enough together. He's not bossy and she'd rather observe than start anything. But the bad thing is that I have little experience with introducing new cats...and now that the old guy is getting into my girl's food, I feel terrible. She's woken me up on occasions earlier than usual cause she's so hungry, which is really unlike her. \n\nSome options I've come up with so far:\n\n* 1) Keep choosing different locations to feed my girl. It worked for a couple days when I fed her at the top of the cat tree as he didn't feel confident enough. But now he does and will follow the sound of her eating...not aggressively, just incessantly. \n* 2) Separate them at night. I feel bad for him, because I live in an apartment and I'd be putting him in the bathroom where I first introduced him. This would solve food-stealing at night, but I'm away during the day at school too. It just doesn't seem realistic right now. \n* 3) Microchip feeder. He isn't microchipped that I'm aware of, but my girl is. I've seen videos that sense the microchip and open for that cat. If placed in a a part of the apt they both don't tend to be in together, maybe it would work well. The downside is it costs $150, but with both of their health potentially effected if this trend continues, I'm willing to invest the money since I put them both in this situation, truly. \n\nIf there are any other tips mult-cat owners have picked up, I'd love to hear them! This is a question clients will absolutely ask me in practice, so 'I don't know' isn't gonna cut it. Open to everything. ",

We found her with worms, so she's been through 2 rounds of medication already for that. She's got a bit of a sensitive stomach from that but otherwise she's fine. \n\nSo basically, unless she gets really sick randomly, the costs at this point would be food, toys and litter box. \n\nI'm going to be living by myself in a bachelor apartment and I'm unsure if she's going to be happy there with just me if I'm working odd hours?

    "title": "Cat constantly cries when I leave the house",
    "description": "My cat is a 5 year old tabby. He was a family members cat when he was only about 2 months old and then they abandoned him so I took him. He's been with me ever since. He's very attached to me and when I'm home he's either always touching me or follows me everywhere I go. This doesn't bother me because I love him very much and think it's really sweet. \n\nThe issue is that I just moved to New York where I'm currently renting only a bedroom that he's not allowed to leave unless I'm holding him or he's in a carrier(my roommates have a very aggressive pit bull and they also aren't very nice in general so I don't trust them). I moved to New York to be with my boyfriend because I am currently 5 months pregnant with our first child, so I spend a lot of time with him at his place and then I also work. My cat, from what I've been told, cries a lot when I'm not there. He'll stand at the bedroom door and just cry constantly. He's not starving or thirsty because he has a timed feeder and water fountain and I also clean his litter regularly, I also leave some of my worn clothes around the room so that he can snuggle them and smell me when I'm gone. I know it's probably just because he misses me and the attention but right now it's honestly just too difficult to dedicate the same kind of time and energy to him until my boyfriend and I can get our own place in a few months. Bringing my cat to my boyfriend's isn't an option because his shared apartment doesn't allow pets. So my question is, how can I get him to calm down and stop crying when I'm not there? Is there anything at all I can do to sooth him until I'm able to get back home and spend time with him? His constant crying is causing an issue and I just can't afford to move apartments right now.

When the other cats get inside my house they're all HUGE in comparison to her, they look like a bunch of tigers, and they're crazy strong. On more than occasion one of them injured my own cat badly enough that she had to be \"quarantined\" inside my house so she could recover. I want her to become stronger so she can defend herself against the other cats, rather than just get beaten time after time. No matter how much she eats, all she gets is fat.

Back then things were really easy going between us, I could pick her up and play with her and she would climb up onto me. Overall she was very friendly with me. Now, whenever I walk past her I have to steer wide of her in case she might try to jump up and scratch me. And she always looks at me waiting for me to do something whenever I walk past her, and she's always hissing at me and growling whenever I try to go and pet her or am over by her in general. Whenever I put my hand close to her she trys to lash out and scratch me. She has become fairly over weight over the years due to how I never play with her and that just about all of her day is walking around the house, eating her food, and laying under my mom's bed. Does anyone have any tips on how I can get her back down to size or how I can get her to I guess like me again? She's 7 years old by the way.",

    "description": "We've had her since 2009, when she was fairly young. She's a great cat, I love her to pieces. When we adopted her, our older male cat was mean to her, and she's never been very social. Older male cat passed away, and when we adopted another cat (2012), she was aggressive towards him. Two kittens were added (unplanned, they sort of wandered into our life needing rescue) to the family in 2014 and she has no interaction with them, but the other male cat is very close with them. She has no aggression towards our dog, who we've had her whole life.\n\nUntil about a year ago, she was fine with the litterbox. She did have an infection on her foot that we thought was cleared up (her nails were splitting and discolored) but she has not started using the litterbox again. She's slowly becoming more social with humans (my boyfriend has been a big part of that) and is out and about more. However, she won't use the litterbox. She will, however, use puppy pads, and will even use it in a litterbox. It's just cat litter she won't go into- whether it's pine, paper or plain litter. We have 5 boxes, which are changed daily, so access isn't an issue. \n\nShe's spayed, doctor says she's healthy, is very sweet and fine with some people (mostly myself, my boyfriend and my brother), but this litterbox issue is a head scratcher. Any thoughts whatsoever? We've tried special pheromone plug ins, different types of litter, everything. \n\nCould she have another foot problem? The roots of her claws are almost always covered in sort of dark scaling. This is my personal theory.\n\nI'd really like to figure this out. Boyfriend and I are moving in in April, and plan to take her with us, but I want her to be as healthy and happy as possible. I think being in a single animal household will help somewhat but the litterbox issue is a big concern. Help? \n\nTL;DR- Cat does not socialize with other cats, was aggressive with one, very selective about people (which is fairly normal). Recently stopped using litter box altogether, but will use pee pads in a box. Are we stuck there or is there a way to help?\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "I've been the owner of a lovely 4 mo. old kitten mutt for about 6 weeks now. He's perfect in every way except a natural, understandable desire to climb on counters &amp; more importantly my fiance's office desk. We live in a 1-bedroom apartment that's quite spacious but the office is attached to the kitchen &amp; there really isn't any way to block off the area. He likes to repeatedly jump on the desk/computer tower &amp; has shut off the comp several times now. I looked into a pet gate but the few I found that were wide enough (112-113 in) were far too short. (He'd scale them easily.) Not to mention they cost a small fortune. Any ideas on how to deter him from this area? It's a pretty small spot he needs to avoid. I have loads of experience with dogs &amp; will be bringing one home soon. (The dog basically ignores cats &amp; gets along with those he's been introduced to very well - still I have a doggie gate &amp; crate for the introduction period.) My fiance works from home &amp; I am on medical disability so I am here virtually all the time but I can't supervise him constantly. This is sort of my first cat (I've taken care of a few over the years) but I honestly believe my wonderful golden trained the last kitty that stayed with me. She wouldn't even jump on the counters without my Golden letting out a single yip to deter her. Right now, my cat is the only pet in the place. It'll be 12 days before the new family member can come home &amp; I'd like to have a solution before then as I'll be focusing on the dog's training a lot.\nAny tips? I'm at a loss.",

He has had to have his anal glands expressed a few months ago but symptoms never returned.\n\nOver Christmas break, we left our apartment for not even 20 hours (we cleaned the litter box entirely) and came home to find multiple presents on the kitchen floor (litter box is in a small attached room).\n\nWe cleaned up the mess and did not think much more about it except the occasional Google regarding the incident. Most searches returned separation anxiety.\n\nThe most recent problem...\n\nYesterday, another gift was dropped around the litter box, and it had a tiny (significantly noticeable) amount of blood at the end. Research stated it was minor tear or constipation but could be alarming if it has occurred multiple times. We decided to take them to the vet today after work.\n\nOn lunch, I stopped by the apartment for a little while, as I was leaving I noticed he was venturing into a corner behind my laptop bag, an unusual spot. I picked him up and a solid stream of urine was spraying. He has not peed outside the litter box since he was a kitten.\n\nAnyone have any ideas to what is going on? ",

It looked like it had been playing around her rain boots and it had fallen over or something and his tail was suck under it (this is second hand info, so I'm not sure).\n\nAnyway, since then he has been having bouts of disorientation, where it looks like he's lost his balance, he keeps circling and you can see that he's leaning/tipping to one side. His eyes will dart around too. It seems to have gotten a bit better, but it sill happens, notably when he gets really excited, like when I came home this evening, he was waiting for me and then started doing it, 1-2 min later he was fine.\n\nHe's also been sneezing a lot lately, so I'm wondering if it's perhaps flu or something? My first thought was that he had a concussion from maybe the boot falling over and hitting him in the head, but it would have been a very soft hit I think as the top of the boot isn't that hard, but the sneezing has me thinking otherwise now.\n\nWe've recently also had a dog staying with us, they have started to be more comfortable around each other, he arrived on christmas say (we're dog sitting her old dog that lives with her ex's mother).\n\nShould I be worrying, will it just pass, or should I take him to the vet?",

The fact I was able to examine her so easily also worries me, as usually she would have no problem biting or scratching to stop me, yet I was able to examine her mouth and abdomen with little resistance, and when I put her down she just curled up again. \n\nThe relatively sudden onset is what concerns me the most.\n\nShe is aged around 4-5 months, and she has been in her first heat cycle for the past few days as well.\n\nWe will take her to the vet tomorrow if there is no improvement, however, as new pet parents, we're worried we're missing something obvious. We're also equally worried that we're completely overreacting and she's getting over a mild virus or something, and the vet will tell us to gtfo.\n\nWould love to hear /r/cats input.\n\nThanks in advance",

Like I said the sound is very loud. It's very forced. \n\n\n I took him to the Vet, and they ran every test imaginable and said the tests came back negative for everything. The vet also mentioned he has a heart murmur, and since of his age he might have heart disease, and apperantly its not uncommon for cats his age to make that sound.\n\n BUT, the thing is, it's ALWAYS moments when he needs to go poop. ALWAYS. I've noticed that sometimes there are traces of blood in his feces from time to time, and it's always soft and dark yellow (think of plit pea soup colored).\n\n He acts normal, and fine when he poops. He doesn't scream. He eats regularly, he purs, he looks absolutely fine. But when it's time for the food to come out the other end, it's always the same dry heaving yelping/screaming sound. \n\n The vet has no clue what it may be, and at this point I just hope maybe someone here might have a clue? \n\nThank you very much!

    "description": "My family's sweet cat, Milo, is approximately 10 years old. Over the summer, in the midst of a move, I was staying in my grandparents' unoccupied house with our two cats, and Milo started to yowl. I wouldn't even say yowl, it almost sounded like screaming. He was clearly in pain, and limping on one back leg. He would not let me touch or hold him (very out of character for him - he is all about attention) and retreated to the closet to hide (again, completely unlike him). He was lying down in a position that put no stress on his back legs and yowling in pain. I put a bowl of water next to his head and sat with him until he stood up, about two hours later. To be honest, I was terrified he was dying. We took him to the vet as soon as they opened, and an X-ray revealed Intervertebral Disc Disease. Two of his vertebrae had completely lost their cushioning, leading to debilitating pain.\n\nWe had him on a concoction of pain medicine for a few weeks, and weaned him off. He hasn't had an episode like that since. He does have some off days here and there, but if you didn't know him, you wouldn't know anything is wrong. It's more or less that he's just ever so slightly lethargic and a little less receptive to affection, sort of being a little \"blah\", but no episodes of debilitating pain. The problem he *is* having, though, is incontinence. He clearly knows how to use the litter box, I've seen him do it, but he's having accidents around the house (only defecation, not urine). It's rarely diarrhea. We know for sure it's him and not our other geriatric cat. At the recommendation of our vet, we're mixing 1/4 teaspoon of Miralax with some wet food, but this doesn't seem to be solving the issue.\n\nAnyone have experience with this? Why is incontinence his only issue, and how can we help him? He's such a sweet, gentle cat, he's the last animal to ever deserve to be having any trouble. This is the cat that somehow knew we were mourning during a funeral reception and made sure to sit in all our laps, one by one, and the cat that spends hours with you, only to leave for a few minutes to get water or go to the bathroom, and comes when called and follows you all around the house. He doesn't deserve to feel badly, I desperately want to help him.\n\n[Mandatory photos.](http://imgur.com/a/0GQdW)",

    "description": "Background.  She came from a home with no cat flap and had to wait for someone to open a window for her to go out to do her toileting. I know she had access to a litterbox when she had kittens (Ã—3 litters) but *not sure* if she was allowed a box once her kittens were homed. \n\nOn to now. One month in. So far she has been kept indoors as recommended by the vet for 3months before letting her outdoors (based in UK so outdoor cats are normal). And adding a teaspoon of water with her tinned food to help her stay hydrated (again vet recommended). Clean water is available next to her food bowl and changed daily. After a few accidental wettings in the first week, she has done all her no.1s and no.2s in the litterbox but when it comes to no.2s (one poop every 2-3 days) she seems to get fretful and nervous and meows like she is anxious to actually go. The poops are *enormous* (much bigger than the average cat turds I sometimes see in the garden) and look slightly constipated at one end only (like she has been holding on to the last minute). Poops are removed and flushed as soon as they are discovered and wood pellets and paper lining changed everyday to remove wet so she has access to a nice clean box. There is no problem when she goes pee. \n\nI think its her previous situation that makes her nervous to poop (having to wait for someone to let her out) so I am asking is there anything that can be done to help her feel happier about pooping and not waiting til shes bustingly full. Or is it just a case of giving her time? Or will this simply resolve itself when she has the choice to go outdoors to poop?\n\nOther than this issue, I am delighted with her progress. She loves being with people. Great appetite. Supervised visits with the other cats have gone well. She's a happy little girl apart from when it comes to having a poop. \n\nThanks for reading! ",

I'm trying to train her that biting doesn't make me put her down when I pick her up and it seems like it occasionally works, but I have to endure several seconds of biting until she stops.\n\nI know she's affectionate and wants attention, and her ears are never back when biting so I don't think it's entirely malicious, just her way of telling me to back off.\n\nOver all, I'm hoping she calms down in a few months and returns to her lap-cat personality she started with.\n\nAny advice?",

    "description": "Will try to keep this short. In our house we had 2 dogs and 1 cat who were all 3-5 years old and got along great. Our cat is so laid back she never has a problem with friend's dogs that come over or anything.  \n  \nMother-in-law doesn't have much regard for life. 1 of our dogs we only have because they got her initially but left her in a kennel unless she was outside because MIL didn't want her \"peeing on the carpet\".. so don't get a fucking puppy and expect it to potty train itself... anyways - so long story short she went out and got 3 kittens for her granddaughter who lives with her knowing full well she didn't intend on keeping all 3. Still not sure how it happened but we ended up taking 1 home.  \n  \nWe kept her in a room on her own for the first week or so. We'd feed them on opposite sides of door. Rubbed cheeks on cloths then put cloth by food to get used to each other scent. The kitten gets along fine with the dogs but her and the cat still do not trust each other.  \n  \nThey sometimes will go nose to nose and no one will growl or hiss. The cat has even licked the kitten. But they still will have occasional little spats of hissing swatting and the cat has chased the kitten on a few occasions hissing and growling. The kitten is only given free roam of the house if we are home otherwise she stays in her room with door shut.  \n  \nI have also caught the cat peeing in the kitten's litter twice now. (They each have a litter box) Not sure if she's trying to be territorial or if she was just being lazy. (Her litter is downstairs)  \n  \nLike I said it's not constant aggression. They can be around each other and most the time they are okay / steer clear. It seems like when 1 tries to play with the other the other doesn't trust that they are playing and will react with a hiss and growl / swatting.  \n  \nWe have had kitten for 1 month now and she is 15-16 weeks old. We are hoping time will help. Kitten also has not been spayed yet but will be very soon so this could help her as well. Is there any advice you guys have that will help our 2 felines coexist?  \n  \n**tl;dr** - Cat and new kitten still have occasional fights. Cat is peeing in kitten litter. Want them to love each other.",

    "description": "I adopted my cat when he was a kitten, and he's 13 years old now. He's always been a vocal cat. The vast majority of the time, it's charming and funny.\n\nMy husband and I recently acquired a roommate. We live in a 4bdrm house, and didn't use two rooms, so it seemed like a good idea. I don't let my cat sleep in our bedroom because he tries to wake me up at 5AM for feeding time. Still, we hang out in there in the evening (have a couch, television, and fireplace)with both our cat and dog, and then kick them out when it's time for bed.\n\nThis hasn't been a problem until the roommate situation.\n\nNow my cat comes to the door and yowls *really* loudly at night about every five minutes to a couple hours. He throws himself against the door. He becomes an extreme dramaticat. We've tried spraying him with water, but he will literally just sit there and become drenched. He purrs every time I open the door to spray him--which is a bit sad and pathetic.\n\nReddit, I haven't gotten a night's good sleep in a month now. I'm trying to do what I can: provide him with a ton of attention and reassurance before bedtime as well as plugging in a Feliway diffuser next to our door. The spray bottle isn't working. This is driving both me and my husband nuts. In addition, we're talking about the possibility of starting a family. I can't imagine that my cat would take that well either, and I also can't imagine being kept awake by both a baby and a cat.\n\nI love my kitty. He is so snuggly and smart and sweet. He is also LOUD.\n\nAny suggestions? I just want to sleep.",

    "description": "Hello! I have a calico female cat that seems to have gone semi-feral after having two litters of kittens and getting fixed. We've kept all of her kittens, 7 males and 1 female, and have them all fixed as well.\n\nI'm asking here because I've looked up how to resocialize her several times and found the articles and sites available just don't cover my particular situation, so I guess I'm looking for custom advice.\n\nHer behavior is that whenever she's in the house, she growls and hisses everywhere and at any and everything, even nothing. She wants to go back outside, but oftentimes she's just come inside after being gone several days. She's semi-friendly to humans, and isn't afraid to come to us and be petted, although growling and hissing the whole time even if she likes the scritches. She seems frustrated when she can't find a way out of the house, going to windows and trying to climb them.\n\nOf course she doesn't like her kittens, she attacks them every time she gets close to them, even going out of her way to do so. They give her plenty of space unless they're utterly passed out, then they get an unpleasant wake-up call. \n\nI know it's just natural for a mother cat to hate her kittens and try to drive them away, but they're all over a year old or close to it now, and she needs to get over it. :\\\nSo my questions are, how can I re-tame and re-socialize her to get her back to the quiet friendly cat she used to be?\n\nI know keeping her in the house a while would definitely be part of it, but is there any specific things I can do in the house to do this effectively?\n\nWhat I have to work with is:\n\nA pretty large house\n\nA spare bedroom she seems to like hiding in a lot\n\nThree pet carriers\n\nCat food and treats\n\nCatnip (which she doesn't seem to like[Edit: Nevermind, she likes it, just not being given it.])\n\n8 other cats, 5 one year old, 3 a bit more than half year olds\n\nA very very very very limited money budget. Like $14.\n\n\nAnd no, we can't take her to the vet. We're poor. The only way they're all fixed, wormed, and vaccinated is because of budget/discount clinics we wheeled them over in a shopping cart to.\n\nThat may sound bad, but these cats are treated better than we are.

    "description": "I would prefer to adopt a kitten, if the opportunity arises and not for a few years at the least, but I'm doing research and thinking more and more about what I would look for in a cat when the time comes. My biggest questions are how to decide on a breed (I am in love with Maine Coons and Turkish Angoras, but would love any breed with a friendly relaxed temperment) and a gender. I had heard rumors that males tend to be more friendly to humans but I can't find any true evidence to support or debunk that claim.\n\nAny other advice you can provide would be very helpful. Before you ask, my living situation currently doesn't matter, I'm considering a cat for after I've moved out of my parents house and I have no other pets. Had a dog for about 10 years which died last year, so I am not new to pet ownership but this would/will be my first cat. (Kinda, we have 2 that we probably technically stole that live on our porch because my mother started feeding them. Please don't flame me on that one, I was away at college and had nothing to do with the decision). ",

But we have not introduced my fiance's paperwork for her companion animal info so if we're caught were not too worried. Just can't get another cat. So my Maincoon named Monroe (brown spot on lip so he got that name) is going on 11 months. He is not yet fixed. But I'm very very nervous he is depressed. He just meows in a cry kind of way over and over and is somewhat disinterested in the toys. We have a laser, wand-string like toy, a donut with the spinny ball, plenty of balls, a scratch mountain that he has not yet scratches on at all, a 3-way multi colored tunnel,  catnjp pixkel which might be stale because he doesn't touch that either, and a light up fluffy thing he humps. \n\nSo here are the problems. He is very lovey and cuddley. He gets very affectionate with both my fiance and I only. That's a good thing. But he will sit around the house meowing and won't play and won't cuddle. So I figure that's the hormones. But at night he will sit outside our bedroom door and claw at the carpet meowing and screaming. When we let him in, no cuddle and no play. Just scream meows but wants to do it in the room. He like wants us but doesn't. He also has a biting issue which I can't seem to kick.\n\nAny advice?... Will post pics if you'd like! His tail is bigger than a racoon tail.",

She's on the crotchety side: not super friendly, likes to be left alone, really only likes my mom.  I moved out during college and I got my own cat (Michi) a year ago; he's less than 2 years old and very playful.  I'm in grad school so I recently moved back in with my mom and sister. Salem is not a fan of Michi at all.  She's very lazy and pretty much stays in my mom's room all day while Michi explores if I'm home.  If no one is home, we separate them.  We have a doorway that divides the house in half.  They've been in the same household for 7 months.\n\nAnyways, Michi pathetically tries to get Salem to play with him to no avail; he usually gets growled and swiped at instead.  Part of me really wants to get another cat so he'll have a playmate but the other half is scared that Salem will retaliate in some way or feel rejected.  Has anyone else been in a similar situation?  Unfortunately, getting my own place with another cat is not an option.",

My favorite was Athena who would follow me around the house and play catch with toys.\n\nMy question is, what would be good signs in kitten or teenagers (&gt;6mos) to know that they'll be playful and bond the same way my previous cats have?",

    "description": "Hey guys,\n\nSo I'm looking to get a kitten for some company as I live in the core of my city in a decent-sized studio apartment (no bedrooms) that has a large walk in closet and 1 bathroom. It's located on the 4th floor of a secured apartment building.\n\nI'm looking for a cat breed that stays small and doesn't shed, and I think I've settled on a Russian Blue. My concerns are mostly the litter being dirty/smelling up the place, that the kitten won't have enough place to live properly (wouldnt want to raise a cat in a bad environment) and that I work 9-5 daily, so I dont know if it'll be getting the attention it needs, especially in the early stages of its life.\n\nFor the litter, apparently there exist electronic litters that clean themselves and just require a bag swap? I'm not sure of the details but a friend was saying that these are a big help and virtually mess-free. Very new to the whole cat lifestyle, so any advice is appreciated regarding litters, breeds, or recommendations for caring for a new kitten.\n\nThanks.",

    "description": "Edit: My friend had a steep and sudden decline within 24 hours of her death this morning.  She's gone now.  Thank you for all your help.  \n\nDue to the weight loss and sneezing, along with her ignoring all dry biscuits that she's eaten for more then ten years and now will only eat wet food (devouring it like a vacuum cleaner!) my vet has told me my lovely 14 year old friend is most likely to have lymphoma, a form of cancer, and if she survives to the end of January it'd be surprising and wonderful.\n\nHe gave her a cortisone injection and a course of tablets, one taken daily, and we'll see what happens.\n\nI've arranged for a photographer to come capture her visual essence for Saturday morning.  \n\nWe've been together for my entire adult life.  She's seen me through the most and worst traumatic things and helped me all along, and I've done the same for her.  She's my best friend.\n\nI have a month to prepare myself.  I have made her a blanket fort under the kitchen table so she can hang out there.  Mostly because it's fun and blanket forts are cool.  And also in case she wants to crawl under a bed and be sick where I can't reach her is bad, and the bed is big so blanket fort is a fun and practical option.\n\nHow can I help my mate out?\n\nAnyone else I speak to denies that she's sick at all.  Despite that whole not eating, not pooping, walking differently, being extra snuggly thing.  \n\nWhen I took xanax in the vet's office the moment he told me she had less than a month to go, he immediately said he wanted to take some too.  I offered him mine, he said he had some in the back that they give to critters sometimes.  He mentioned it again as we were paying the bill.  The patient he had directly before us was also a cat on their way out of this world.  It's a hard world for vets.  I guess it just stacks up sometime.  I'm sending that guy a card.\n\nIn the meantime, I want your suggestions for having a kickass month with my best friend.  \n\nAfter the vet today we went straight to a park and hung out for a while.  Lying in the sun, playing on the playground, smelling lots of things, looking at chickens in someone's fenced back yard, and watching a dog from a distance who watched her back for ages.  \n\nHelp.  Please help this month be more awesome than I know how.",

    "description": "Hey all,\n\nmy cat, [Douchy](http://imgur.com/gDIZEHo), has started biting his paw recently after a stressful event, to the point that he inflicted himself a [wound that needed medical attention](http://imgur.com/2IdJ0O6). We went to the vet and now we have an \nointment, antibiotic and a [collar-cone](http://imgur.com/oMrAyFZ) so that he doesn't keep biting or licking his paw.\n\n\nNow the problem : he turns batshit crazy when we put the collar on, to the point that he rams into anything that's within his reach and we're afraid he'll hurt himself even more by doing so. Now everything (pet shop, vet etc) is closed for 2 days for the New year and we're stuck with no other options. Is there anything else we could do to help him, without the collar?\n\n\n\nThank you very much for your help!",
